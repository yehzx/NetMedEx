38258094|a|In this study, we evaluated IL-15 stimulated natural killer cell-derived EVs (NK-EVs) as therapeutic agents in vitro and in vivo in Osimertinib-resistant lung cancer (H1975R) with EGFR mutations (L858R) in combination with carboplatin (CBP). NK-EVs were isolated by ultracentrifugation and characterized by nanoparticle tracking analysis, and atomic force microscopy imaging revealed vesicles with a spherical form and sizes meeting the criteria of exosomal EVs. Further, Western blot studies demonstrated the presence of regular EV markers along with specific NK markers (perforin and granzyme). EVs were also characterized by proteomic analysis, which demonstrated that EVs had proteins for natural killer cell-mediated cytotoxicity (Granzyme B) and T cell activation (perforin and plastin-2). Gene oncology analysis showed that these differentially expressed proteins are involved in programmed cell death and positive regulation of cell death. Further, isolated NK-EVs were cytotoxic to H1975R cells in vitro in 2D and 3D cell cultures. CBP's IC50 was reduced by approximately in 2D and 3D cell cultures when combined with NK-EVs. The EVs were then combined with CBP and administered by i.p. route to H1975R tumor xenografts, and a significant reduction in tumor volume in vivo was observed. Our findings show for the first time that NK-EVs target the PD-L1/PD-1 immunological checkpoint to induce apoptosis and anti-inflammatory response by downregulation of SOD2, PARP, BCL2, SET, NF-kappaB, and TGF-ss. The ability to isolate functional NK-EVs on a large scale and use them with platinum-based drugs may lead to new clinical applications. The results of the present study suggest the possibility of the combination of NK-cell-derived EVs and CBP as a viable immunochemotherapeutic strategy for resistant cancers.

38601677|t|Pharmacogenomics-based systematic review of coronary artery disease based on personalized medicine procedure.
38601677|a|Background: Coronary artery disease (CAD) is the most common reason for mortality and disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) lost globally. This study aimed to suggest a new gene list for the treatment of CAD by a systematic review of bioinformatics analyses of pharmacogenomics impacts of potential genes and variants. Methods: PubMed search was filtered by the title including Coronary Artery Disease during 2020-2023. To find the genes with pharmacogenetic impact on the CAD, additional filtrations were considered according to the variant annotations. Protein-Protein Interactions (PPIs), Gene-miRNA Interactions (GMIs), Protein-Drug Interactions (PDIs), and variant annotation assessments (VAAs) performed by STRING-MODEL (ver. 12), Cytoscape (ver. 3.10), miRTargetLink.2., NetworkAnalyst (ver 0.3.0), and PharmGKB. Results: Results revealed 5618 publications, 1290 papers were qualified, and finally, 650 papers were included. 4608 protein-coding genes were extracted, among them, 1432 unique genes were distinguished and 530 evidence-based repeated genes remained. 71 genes showed a pharmacogenetics-related variant annotation in at least (entirely 6331 annotations). Variant annotation assessment (VAA) showed 532 potential variants for the final report, and finally, the concluding PGs list represented 175 variants. Based on the function and MAF, 57 nonsynonymous variants of 29 Pharmacogenomics-related genes were associated with CAD. Conclusion: Conclusively, evaluating circulating miR33a in individuals' plasma with CAD, and genotyping of rs2230806, rs2230808, rs2487032, rs12003906, rs2472507, rs2515629, and rs4149297 (ABCA1 variants) lead to precisely prescribing of well-known drugs. Also, the findings of this review can be used in both whole-genome sequencing (WGS) and whole-exome sequencing (WES) analysis in the prognosis and diagnosis of CAD.
