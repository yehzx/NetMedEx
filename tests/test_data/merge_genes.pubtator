8975696|t|Molecular phylogeny of grey mullets based on mitochondrial DNA sequence analysis: evidence of a differential rate of evolution at the intrafamily level.
8975696|a|The phylogeny of the grey mullets is considered problematic both at the intra- and interfamily level. Such a difficulty arises from the highly homogeneous morphology displayed by this group of fish and, consequently, from the paucity of the key morphological characters suitable to address their phylogeny and evolution. In the present work, we have approached the phylogenetic and evolutionary relationships of seven species of Mugilidae, six of which from the Mediterranean Sea, on the basis of the DNA sequences of two mitochondrial genes (cytochrome b and 12S rRNA). Despite the morphological homogeneity exhibited by the taxa considered, the two species of the genus Mugil (M. cephalus and M. curema) showed a remarkable genetic divergence compared to all the other members of the family. The relative rate test revealed a significantly higher rate of evolution along the Mugil lineage.

33110380|t|A non-exhaustive survey revealed possible genetic similarity in mitochondrial adaptive evolution of marine fish species in the northwestern Pacific.
33110380|a|Mitochondrial coding genes involved in the oxidative phosphorylation pathway play vitally important roles in energy production and thermal adaptation. Investigating the underlying molecular mechanism of mitochondrial adaptive evolution is crucial for understanding biodiversity and ecological radiation. In this study, we collated population genetic studies of marine fish species in the northwestern Pacific based on mitochondrial cytochrome b gene sequences, to investigate whether similar patterns could be detected in mitochondrial adaptive evolution. After filtering, nine studies containing eight marine fish species (Ammodytes personatus, Boleophthalmus pectinirostris, Larimichthys polyactis, Mugil cephalus, Pampus argenteus, Platycephalus sp.1, Sebastiscus marmoratus, and Trachidermus fasciatus) belonging to eight different families were retained. Multiple codon-based approaches were used to identify potential sites under selection in each species. By comparison, our results showed that the posterior part of the mitochondrial cytochrome b gene (particularly codon 372 and its neighboring sites) seemed to be involved in the adaptive evolution process, suggesting potential genetic similarity among distantly related species. We also summarized four types of adaptive patterns in the reviewed species, and suggest that the level of genetic differentiation and mitochondrial adaptive evolution might be correlated. Further studies are needed to confirm such relationship by detecting RNA-level evidence and investigating more species and samples.

33809419|t|Markers of Genetic Variation in Blue Gourami (Trichogaster trichopterus) as a Model for Labyrinth Fish.
33809419|a|Markers of genetic variation between species are important for both applied and basic research. Here, various genes of the blue gourami (Trichogaster trichopterus, suborder Anabantoidei, a model labyrinth fish), many of them involved in growth and reproduction, are reviewed as markers of genetic variation. The genes encoding the following hormones are described: kisspeptins 1 and 2, gonadotropin-releasing hormones 1, 2, and 3, growth hormone, somatolactin, prolactin, follicle- stimulating hormone and luteinizing hormone, as well as mitochondrial genes encoding cytochrome b and 12S rRNA. Genetic markers in blue gourami, representing the suborder Anabantoidei, differ from those in other bony fishes. The sequence of the mitochondrial cytochrome c oxidase subunit 1 (COI) gene of blue gourami is often used to study the Anabantoidei suborder. Among the genes involved in controlling growth and reproduction, the most suitable genetic markers for distinguishing between species of the Anabantoidei have functions in the hypothalamic-pituitary-somatotropic axis: pituitary adenylate cyclase-activating polypeptide and growth hormone, and the 12S rRNA gene.
