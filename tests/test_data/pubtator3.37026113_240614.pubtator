37026113|a|Background: Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is characterized by poor regulation of the immune response leading to chronic inflammation and multiple organ dysfunction. Glucocorticoid (GC) is currently one of the main treatments. However, a high dose or prolonged use of GC may result in glucocorticoid-induced osteoporosis (GIOP). Jiedu Quyu Ziyin decoction (JP) is effective in treating SLE and previous clinical studies have proved that JP can prevent and treat SLE steroid osteoporosis (SLE-GIOP). We aim to examine JPs main mechanism on SLE-GIOP through network pharmacology and molecular docking. Methods: TCMSP and TCMID databases were used to screen potential active compounds and targets of JP. The SLE-GIOP targets are collected from GeneCards, OMIM, PharmGkb, TTD, and DrugBank databases. R software was used to obtain the cross-targets of JP and SLE-GIOP and to perform GO and KEGG enrichment analysis. Cytoscape software was used to make the Chinese Medicines-Active Ingredient-Intersection Targets network diagram. STRING database construct protein-protein interaction network and obtain the core targets. Auto Dock Tools and Pymol software were used for docking. Results: Fifty eight targets overlapped between JP and SLE-GIOP were suggested as potential targets of JP in the treatment of SLE-GIOP. Network topology analysis identified five core targets. GO enrichment analysis was obtained 1,968 items, and the top 10 biological process, closeness centrality, and molecular function were displayed. A total of 154 signaling pathways were obtained by KEGG enrichment analysis, and the top 30 signaling pathways were displayed. JP was well bound by MAPK1, TP53, and MYC according to the molecular docking results. Conclusion: We investigated the potential targets and signaling pathways of JP against SLE-GIOP in this study. It shows that JP is most likely to achieve the purpose of treating SLE-GIOP by promoting the proliferation and differentiation of osteoblasts. A solid theoretical foundation will be provided for the future study of clinical and experimental topics.
