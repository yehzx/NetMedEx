34660934|t|Biochemical properties and shelf life of value-added fish cube and powder developed from hilsa shad (Tenualosa ilisha).
34660934|a|Hilsa shad (Tenualosa ilisha) is one of the most popular and tastiest fishes in Southeast Asia because of its unique soft texture, mouth-watering flavor, high nutritive value with high protein, and very high lipid, attractive body shape, and highly appealing shiny appearance. Recently increased productions of hilsa, in association with high demand but very high price, make it to be a good candidate for value-addition. The major challenge of hilsa value addition lies in its high lipid content, while lipids are the reasons for its unique tastiness. Under a national initiative, the present study therefore developed novel methods to prepare hilsa cube and hilsa powder by stabilizing lipids and proteins, which contained the original taste and flavor of hilsa, and had good storability in freezing and room temperature conditions for 6 months. The pre-spawning, moderate size (600-700g) female hilsa was used for product formulation. Proximate composition, biochemical qualities (TVB-N, TMA-N, pH, PV, TBA value, histamine content) of the hilsa cube and powder were analyzed following standard methods and sensory properties were analyzed using a 5-point hedonic scale. The biochemical parameters and sensory properties of the products varied based on ingredients used and the final product states. Both the products were in good quality for 6 months of storage, since cryoprotectants protected the protein quality both during freezing and high-temperature processing. Carotenoid extract from fresh carrots was found to be effective in reducing lipid oxidation in hilsa. Biochemical attributes in all products gradually decreased with storage time (p < 0.05). Almost similar sensory attributes were observed in both hilsa powder and hilsa cube, which were gradually decreased (p > 0.05) with the progress of the storage period. Both the products were within the acceptable quality limit during all storage periods and conditions. The results suggest that hilsa cube and powder have excellent quality standards, storage stability, and the possibility for fortifying ready-to-eat value-added hilsa products for the consumers at home and aboard.
