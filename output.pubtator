21359185|t|An epidemiological study of concomitant use of Chinese medicine and antipsychotics in schizophrenic patients: implication for herb-drug interaction.
21359185|a|BACKGROUND: Herb-drug interactions are an important issue in drug safety and clinical practice. The aim of this epidemiological study was to characterize associations of clinical outcomes with concomitant herbal and antipsychotic use in patients with schizophrenia. METHODS AND FINDINGS: In this retrospective, cross-sectional study, 1795 patients with schizophrenia who were randomly selected from 17 psychiatric hospitals in China were interviewed face-to-face using a structured questionnaire. Association analyses were conducted to examine correlates between Chinese medicine (CM) use and demographic, clinical variables, antipsychotic medication mode, and clinical outcomes. The prevalence of concomitant CM and antipsychotic treatment was 36.4% [95% confidence interval (95% CI) 34.2%-38.6%]. Patients using concomitant CM had a significantly greater chance of improved outcomes than non-CM use (61.1% vs. 34.3%, OR = 3.44, 95% CI 2.80-4.24). However, a small but significant number of patients treated concomitantly with CM had a greater risk of developing worse outcomes (7.2% vs. 4.4%, OR = 2.06, 95% CI 2.06-4.83). Significant predictors for concomitant CM treatment-associated outcomes were residence in urban areas, paranoid psychosis, and exceeding 3 months of CM use. Herbal medicine regimens containing Radix Bupleuri, Fructus Gardenia, Fructus Schisandrae, Radix Rehmanniae, Akebia Caulis, and Semen Plantaginis in concomitant use with quetiapine, clozapine, and olanzepine were associated with nearly 60% of the risk of adverse outcomes. CONCLUSIONS: Concomitant herbal and antipsychotic treatment could produce either beneficial or adverse clinical effects in schizophrenic population. Potential herb-drug pharmacokinetic interactions need to be further evaluated.

24527043|t|Effectiveness, medication patterns, and adverse events of traditional chinese herbal patches for osteoarthritis: a systematic review.
24527043|a|Objective. The aim of this study is to systematically evaluate the evidence whether traditional Chinese herbal patches (TCHPs) for osteoarthritis (OA) are effective and safe and analyze their medication patterns. Methods. A systematic literature search was performed using all the possible Medical Subject Headings (MeSH) and keywords from January 1979 to July 2013. Both randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and observational studies were included. Estimated effects were analyzed using mean difference (MD) or relative risk (RR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI) and meta-analysis. Results. 86 kinds of TCHPs were identified. RCTs and controlled clinical trials (CCTs) which were mostly of low quality favored TCHPs for local pain and dysfunction relief. TCHPs, compared with diclofenac ointment, had significant effects on global effectiveness rate (RR = 0.50; 95% CI (0.29, 0.87)). Components of formulae were mainly based on the compounds "Xiao Huo Luo Dan" (Minor collateral-freeing pill) and "Du Huo Ji Sheng Tang" (Angelicae Pubescentis and Loranthi decoction). Ten kinds of adverse events (AEs), mainly consisting of itching and/or local skin rashes, were identified after 3-4 weeks of follow-up. Conclusions. TCHPs have certain evidence in improving global effectiveness rate for OA; however, more rigorous studies are warranted to support their use.

24527047|t|The effect of complementary and alternative medicine on subfertile women with in vitro fertilization.
24527047|a|About 10-15% of couples have difficulty conceiving at some point in their reproductive lives and thus have to seek specialist fertility care. One of the most commonly used treatment options is in vitro fertilization (IVF) and its related expansions. Despite many recent technological advances, the average IVF live birth rate per single initiated cycle is still only 30%. Consequently, there is a need to find new therapies to promote the efficiency of the procedure. Many patients have turned to complementary and alternative medical (CAM) treatments as an adjuvant therapy to improve their chances of success when they undergo IVF treatment. At present, several CAM methods have been used in infertile couples with IVF, which has achieved obvious effects. However, biologically plausible mechanisms of the action of CAM for IVF have not been systematically reviewed. This review briefly summarizes the current progress of the impact of CAM on the outcomes of IVF and introduces the mechanisms.

24606767|t|Chinese herbal prescriptions for osteoarthritis in Taiwan: analysis of National Health Insurance dataset.
24606767|a|BACKGROUND: Chinese herbal medicine (CHM) has been commonly used for treating osteoarthritis in Asia for centuries. This study aimed to conduct a large-scale pharmaco-epidemiologic study and evaluate the frequency and patterns of CHM used in treating osteoarthritis in Taiwan. METHODS: A complete database (total 22,520,776 beneficiaries) of traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) outpatient claims offered by the National Health Insurance program in Taiwan for the year 2002 was employed for this research. Patients with osteoarthritis were identified according to the diagnostic code of the International Classification of Disease among claimed visiting files. Corresponding prescription files were analyzed, and an association rule was applied to evaluate the co-prescription of CHM for treating osteoarthritis. RESULTS: There were 20,059 subjects who visited TCM clinics for osteoarthritis and received a total of 32,050 CHM prescriptions. Subjects between 40 and 49 years of age comprised the largest number of those treated (19.2%), followed by 50-59 years (18.8%) and 60-69 years group (18.2%). In addition, female subjects used CHMs for osteoarthritis more frequently than male subjects (female: male = 1.89: l). There was an average of 5.2 items prescribed in the form of either an individual Chinese herb or formula in a single CHM prescription for osteoarthritis. Du-zhong (Eucommia bark) was the most commonly prescribed Chinese single herb, while Du-huo-ji-sheng-tang was the most commonly prescribed Chinese herbal formula for osteoarthritis. According to the association rule, the most commonly prescribed formula was Du-huo-ji-sheng-tang plus Shen-tong-zhu-yu-tang, and the most commonly prescribed triple-drug combination was Du-huo-ji-sheng-tang, Gu-sui-pu (Drynaria fortune (Kunze) J. Sm.), and Xu-Duan (Himalaya teasel). Nevertheless, further clinical trials are needed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of these CHMs for treating osteoarthritis. CONCLUSIONS: This study conducted a large scale pharmaco-epidemiology survey of Chinese herbal medicine use in OA patients by analyzing the NHIRD in Taiwan in year 2002.

24661966|t|Lignans from the stems of Clematis armandii ("Chuan-Mu-Tong") and their anti-neuroinflammatory activities.
24661966|a|ETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE: The dried stems of Clematis armandii (Caulis clematidis armandii), named "Chuan-Mu-Tong" in Chinese Pharmacopoeia, have been traditionally used as an herbal remedy mainly for inflammation-associated diseases. The Aim of the study is to identify the potential anti-neuroinflammatory components from Clematis armandii. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The ethanol extract of "Chuan-Mu-Tong" was suspended in H2O and exhaustively extracted with CH2Cl2. The CH2Cl2 fraction was successively subjected to column chromatography (CC) over silica gel, Sephadex LH-20, and semi-preparative HPLC. The structures of the isolated compounds were identified by spectroscopic methods and by comparison with those reported in the literature. Their anti-neuroinflammatory activities were evaluated by inhibitory effects on pro-inflammatory mediators [e.g. nitric oxide (NO) and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha)] in lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-activated BV-2 cells. RESULTS: One new and sixteen known lignans were isolated and characterized. The absolute configuration of the new lignan, (7R,8S)-9-acetyl-dehydrodiconiferyl alcohol (1), was elucidated by a combination of 1D/2D NMR techniques and the Electronic Circular Dichroism (ECD) spectroscopy based on the empirical helicity rules. The anti-neuroinflammatory bioassay showed that compounds 1, (7R,8S)-dehydrodiconiferyl alcohol (2), erythro-guaiacylglycerol-beta-coniferyl ether (5), and threo-guaiacylglycerol-beta-coniferyl ether (6) displayed significant inhibitory effects on NO production. Among them, neolignans 1 and 2 exhibited more potent activities than the positive control (N(G)-monomethyl-L-arginine, L-NMMA), with an IC50 value of 9.3 and 3.9 muM, respectively. Moreover, both 1 and 2 were also found to concentration-dependently suppress the TNF-alpha release in LPS-stimulated BV-2 cells. CONCLUSION: The results revealed that lignans are the major components of "Chuan-Mu-Tong", and their anti-neuroinflammatory activities strongly support the traditional application of this herb medicine on inflammation. Moreover, the dihydrobenzo[b]furan neolignans 1 and 2 as well as Caulis clematidis armandii could be further exploited as new therapeutic agents to treat inflammation-mediated neurodegenerative and aging-associated diseases.

Several parameters including total research output, its growth, rank and global publication share, citation impact, share of international collaborative papers and major collaborative partner countries and patterns of research communication in most productive journals were studied. RESULTS: China's world ranking improved to 8(th) position in 2008. The cumulative publication output of China accounts for 39.69 % share of international collaborative papers during 1999-2008. Chinese authors in neuroscience field together contributed 794 papers, with an average of 49.63 papers per author. CONCLUSION: The top 49 highly cited papers in neurosciences from China had scored higher impact with 126.73 citations per paper. These 49 high-cited papers have appeared in 25 journals and are affiliated to 32 Chinese institutions.




25431765|t|Chinese herbs containing aristolochic acid associated with renal failure and urothelial carcinoma: a review from epidemiologic observations to causal inference.
25431765|a|Herbal remedies containing aristolochic acid (AA) have been designated to be a strong carcinogen. This review summarizes major epidemiologic evidence to argue for the causal association between AA exposure and urothelial carcinoma as well as nephropathy. The exposure scenarios include the following: Belgian women taking slimming pills containing single material Guang Fang Ji, consumptions of mixtures of Chinese herbal products in the general population and patients with chronic renal failure in Taiwan, occupational exposure in Chinese herbalists, and food contamination in farming villages in valleys of the Danube River. Such an association is corroborated by detecting specific DNA adducts in the tumor tissue removed from affected patients. Preventive actions of banning such use and education to the healthcare professionals and public are necessary for the safety of herbal remedies.

25671509|t|Nano-magnetic immunosensor based on staphylococcus protein a and the amplification effect of HRP-conjugated phage antibody.
25671509|a|In this research, super-paramagnetic Fe3O4 nanoparticles (magnetic particles) were coated with Staphylococcus protein A (SPA) and coupled with polyclonal antibody (pcAb) to construct magnetic capturing probes, and HRP-conjugated phage antibody was then used as specific detecting probe to design a labeled immunosensor for trace detection of Staphylococcus aureus enterotoxin B (SEB). The linear detection range of the sensor was 0.008~125 microg/L, the regression equation was Y = 0.487X + 1.2 (R = 0.996, N = 15, p < 0.0001), the limit of detection (LOD) was 0.008 microg/L, and the limit of quantification (LOQ) was 0.008 microg/L. HRP-conjugated phage antibody, SPA and magnetic particles can enhance the sensitivity 4-fold, 3-fold and 2.6-fold higher, respectively. Compared with conventional double-antibody sandwich ELISA, the detection sensitivity of the sensor was 31-fold higher resulting from the integrated amplifying effect. The immunosensor integrates the unique advantages of SPA-oriented antibody as magnetic capturing probe, HRP-conjugated phage antibody as detecting probe, magnetic separation immunoassay technique, and several other advanced techniques, so it achieves high sensitivity, specificity and interference-resistance. It is proven to be well suited for analysis of trace SEB in various environmental samples with high recovery rate and reproducibility.

25685167|t|Identifying chinese herbal medicine network for eczema: implications from a nationwide prescription database.
25685167|a|Eczema is a highly prevalent dermatological disease that can severely affect the patient's quality of life. Chinese herbal medicine (CHM) is commonly used in combination for eczema due to the complicated pathogenesis. This study aimed to identify a CHM network for the treatment of eczema by using a nationwide database. During 2011, 381,282 CHM prescriptions made for eczema (ICD-9-CM 692.x) were obtained from the National Health Insurance Research Database (NHIRD) in Taiwan and analyzed by using association rule mining and social network analysis. Among 661 available CHMs, 44 important combinations were identified. Among the CHM networks, seven clusters with the predominant traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) pattern were recognized. The largest CHM cluster was used to treat the wind-dampness-heat pattern, and Xiao-Feng-San (24.1% of all prescriptions) was the core of this cluster with anti-inflammation, antioxidation, and antiallergic effects. Lonicera japonica (11.0% of all prescriptions) with Forsythia suspense (17.0% of all prescriptions) was the most commonly used CHM combination and was also the core treatment for treating the heat pattern, in which an antimicrobial effect is found. CHM network analysis is helpful for TCM doctors or researchers to choose candidates for clinical practice or further studies.

25883670|t|Safety of chinese herbal medicine for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.
25883670|a|Chinese herbal medicine (CHM) is increasingly used by patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD); however, there has been no systematic evaluation of its safety. This review examined the adverse events (AEs) reported in clinical studies of CHM for COPD. Five English databases (PubMed, Embase, CINAHL, AMED, and CENTRAL) and four Chinese databases (CBM, CNKI, CQVIP, and Wanfang Data) were searched from inception to May 2013. Adverse event data, including nature, severity, author-assigned causality, management, and outcome, were extracted from included studies. Descriptive statistics were used for the rate of adverse events. Of the 152 included studies, AEs were reported in 47 studies. The rate of adverse events was slightly lower in the CHM groups compared with controls (84 events in 5,909 participants, 1.4% versus 102 events in 5,676 participants, 1.8%). The most frequently reported adverse event was nausea (28 cases in the CHM groups and 19 cases in the control groups), which was more common in studies where CHM was combined with pharmacotherapy to treat acute exacerbation of COPD. Other frequent adverse events were abdominal discomfort, dry mouth, and dizziness. Detailed information about the adverse events was scant. Overall, CHM appears to be well tolerated in people with COPD.

26132382|t|ITS2 Secondary Structure Improves Discrimination between Medicinal "Mu Tong" Species when Using DNA Barcoding.
26132382|a|DNA barcoding is a promising species identification method, but it has proved difficult to find a standardized DNA marker in plant. Although the ITS/ITS2 RNA transcript has been proposed as the core barcode for seed plants, it has been criticized for being too conserved in some species to provide enough information or too variable in some species to align it within the different taxa ranks. We selected 30 individuals, representing 16 species and four families, to explore whether ITS2 can successfully resolve species in terms of secondary structure. Secondary structure was predicted using Mfold software and sequence-structure was aligned by MARNA. RNAstat software transformed the secondary structures into 28 symbol code data for maximum parsimony (MP) analysis. The results showed that the ITS2 structures in our samples had a common four-helix folding type with some shared motifs. This conserved structure facilitated the alignment of ambiguous sequences from divergent families. The structure alignment yielded a MP tree, in which most topological relationships were congruent with the tree constructed using nucleotide sequence data. When the data was combined, we obtained a well-resolved and highly supported phylogeny, in which individuals of a same species were clustered together into a monophyletic group. As a result, the different species that are often referred to as the herb "Mu tong" were successfully identified using short fragments of 250 bp ITS2 sequences, together with their secondary structure. Thus our analysis strengthens the potential of ITS2 as a promising DNA barcode because it incorporates valuable secondary structure information that will help improve discrimination between species. 




26287228|t|Prevalence of Polyherbacy in Ambulatory Visits to Traditional Chinese Medicine Clinics in Taiwan.
26287228|a|Patients with a polyherbal prescription are more likely to receive duplicate medications and thus suffer from adverse drug reactions. We conducted a population-based retrospective study to examine the items of Chinese herbal medicine (CHM) per prescription in the ambulatory care of traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) in Taiwan. We retrieved complete TCM ambulatory visit datasets for 2010 from the National Health Insurance database in Taiwan. A total of 59,790 patients who received 313,482 CHM prescriptions were analyzed. Drug prescriptions containing more than five drugs were classified as polyherbal prescriptions; 41.6% of patients were given a polyherbal prescription. There were on average 5.2 +- 2.5 CHMs: 2.3 +- 1.1 compound herbal formula items, and 3.0 +- 2.5 single Chinese herb items in a single prescription. Approximately 4.6% of patients were prescribed 10 CHMs or more. Men had a lower odds ratio (OR) among polyherbal prescriptions (OR = 0.96, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.92-0.99), and middle-aged patients (35-49 years) had the highest frequency of polyherbal prescription (OR = 1.19, 95% CI = 1.13-1.26). Patients with neoplasm, skin and subcutaneous tissue disease, or genitourinary system disease were more likely to have a polyherbal prescription; OR = 2.20 (1.81-2.67), 1.65 (1.50-1.80), and 1.52 (1.40-1.64), respectively. Polyherbal prescription is widespread in TCM in Taiwan. Potential herb interactions and iatrogenic risks associated with polyherbal prescriptions should be monitored.

26413149|t|Efficacy of combining oral Chinese herbal medicine and NB-UVB in treating psoriasis vulgaris: a systematic review and meta-analysis.
26413149|a|BACKGROUND: The combination of a Chinese herbal medicine (CHM) bath and narrowband ultraviolet B (NB-UVB) improved the efficacy of NB-UVB treatment of psoriasis vulgaris, but bath therapy is inconvenient. Oral CHM plus NB-UVB has been tested in clinical practice. This study aims to evaluate whether adding oral CHM could be beneficial for NB-UVB therapy by a systematic review and meta-analysis. METHODS: Nine English and Chinese databases were searched from their inception to April 2014. Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) comparing the combination of orally administered CHM and NB-UVB with that of CHM placebo and NB-UVB or NB-UVB alone for treating psoriasis vulgaris and reporting Psoriasis Area Severity Index (PASI) outcomes were included. A systematic review, meta-analysis, risk of bias assessment and the GRADE assessment were conducted in accordance with Cochrane Collaboration methodology to assess the evidence for efficacy outcome. Data were analyzed in RevMan5.2. RESULTS: Eighteen eligible RCTs (n = 1416) were included for systematic review, and 17 (n = 1342) of them were included in meta-analysis. Risk of bias in terms of blinding was high and so was in publication bias. Quality of evidence was low according the GRADE assessment. PASI-60 or above [risk ratio (RR) = 1.35, 95 % confidence interval (CI) 1.26-1.45, I(2) = 5 %, number needed to treat = 4.27] and PASI-90 or above (RR = 1.71, 95 % CI 1.45-2.01, I(2) = 0 %, number needed to treat = 5.92) were higher in the intervention group. The combination treatment conferred a 24 % benefit of PASI-60 or above (83 vs 59 %, RR = 1.35, 95 % CI 1.26-1.45, P < 0.01). The incidence of NB-UVB-induced adverse events was lower in the intervention group (95/464 vs 123/428, RR = 0.66, 95 % CI 0.46-0.96, P < 0.01). Mild gastrointestinal reactions (2.87 %) and liver function impairments (0.68 %) were reported in the intervention group. No serious adverse events were reported. CONCLUSION: The orally administrated CHM combined with NB-UVB in treating psoriasis vulgaris showed improved efficacy but quality of evidence was low.

26609310|t|Effectiveness and Safety of Manufactured Chinese Herbal Formula for Knee Osteoarthritis: Insights from a Systematic Review.
26609310|a|Objective. To assess the current clinical evidence of manufactured Chinese herbal formulae (MCHF) for knee osteoarthritis (KOA). Methods. Seven databases were searched from inception to May 2015. Eligible randomized controlled trials investigating the effectiveness of MCHF for KOA were included. Data extraction, methodological assessment, and meta-analyses were conducted according to the Cochrane standards. Results. A total of 17 kinds of MCHF were identified from the twenty-six included trials. Meta-analyses showed that MCHF significantly relieved the global pain of knee joints, either used alone or combined with routine treatments. Additionally, MCHF plus routine treatments significantly decreased the scores of WOMAC and Lequesne index. However, there were no statistical differences between MCHF group and routine treatment group in walk-related pain and WOMAC scores. No significant differences were found in Lysholm scores. There were twenty-one trials that mentioned adverse events. A pooled analysis showed that adverse events occurred more frequently in control group compared with MCHF group. Conclusions. Our results indicated that MCHF showed some potential benefits for KOA. However, we still cannot draw firm conclusions due to the poor methodological quality of included trials. More high-quality RCTs would help to confirm the evidence.

26834824|t|Chinese herbal medicines as a source of molecules with anti-enterovirus 71 activity.
26834824|a|Enterovirus 71 (EV71) is one of the causative agents of hand, foot, and mouth disease (HFMD), which sometimes leads to severe neurological disease and death in the Asia-Pacific region. In Chinese medicine, HFMD is caused mainly by an accumulation of damp-heat and toxicity in the body. No effective drugs are currently available for the treatment and prevention of EV71 infection. This review summarizes the potential Chinese herbal extracts and isolated compounds with antiviral activity against EV71 and their clinical applications, especially those categorized as heat-clearing and detoxifying.

26980517|t|HerDing: herb recommendation system to treat diseases using genes and chemicals.
26980517|a|In recent years, herbs have been researched for new drug candidates because they have a long empirical history of treating diseases and are relatively free from side effects. Studies to scientifically prove the medical efficacy of herbs for target diseases often spend a considerable amount of time and effort in choosing candidate herbs and in performing experiments to measure changes of marker genes when treating herbs. A computational approach to recommend herbs for treating diseases might be helpful to promote efficiency in the early stage of such studies. Although several databases related to traditional Chinese medicine have been already developed, there is no specialized Web tool yet recommending herbs to treat diseases based on disease-related genes. Therefore, we developed a novel search engine, HerDing, focused on retrieving candidate herb-related information with user search terms (a list of genes, a disease name, a chemical name or an herb name). HerDing was built by integrating public databases and by applying a text-mining method. The HerDing website is free and open to all users, and there is no login requirement. Database URL: http://combio.gist.ac.kr/herding.




27087820|t|An Analysis of the Combination Frequencies of Constituent Medicinal Herbs in Prescriptions for the Treatment of Stroke in Korean Medicine: Determination of a Group of Candidate Prescriptions for Universal Use.
27087820|a|In contrast to Western medicine, which typically prescribes one medicine to treat a specific disease, traditional East Asian medicine uses any one of a large number of different prescriptions (mixtures of medicinal herbs), according to the patient's characteristics. Although this can be considered an advantage, the lack of a universal prescription for a specific disease is considered a drawback of traditional East Asian medicine. The establishment of universally applicable prescriptions for specific diseases is therefore required. As a basic first step in this process, this study aimed to select prescriptions used in the treatment of stroke and, through the analysis of medicinal herb combination frequencies, select a high-frequency medicinal herb combination group for further experimental and clinical research. As a result, we selected some candidates of a medicinal herb combination and 13 candidates of a medicinal herb for the treatment of stroke.

27347002|t|Chinese herbal medicine for constipation: zheng-based associations among herbs, formulae, proprietary medicines, and herb-drug interactions.
27347002|a|BACKGROUND: As current symptomatic treatments of constipation are still unsatisfactory, an increasing number of patients seek help from Chinese medicine (CM), particularly Chinese herbal medicine (CHM). This study aimed to review the most frequently used CHM herbs and formulae, proprietary CHMs, and herb-drug interactions for functional constipation using zheng (syndrome)-based differentiation, and to determine the current practice of zheng-based CHM treatments for functional constipation. METHODS: We developed a search strategy to include all the related clinical studies of CHM for constipation and set inclusion and exclusion criteria as studies on subjects with constipation of all ages and both sexes, using objective measures from laboratory or imaging techniques. The interventions included single herbs, CM classical formulae, CM new formulae, and Chinese herb-derived products and combination products. The clinical study types included were quasi- or randomized controlled trials, observational clinical studies, case series or case reports, and other types of appropriate research methods. The data concerning study design, sample size, mode of recruitment, sampling and diagnostic procedure, inclusion and exclusion criteria, and participants' characteristics (including age, sex, and duration of constipation). CM patterns, CM treatment principles, treatment regimen, and CM treatment outcomes were recorded. RESULTS: A total of 29,832 relevant records were found, of which 8541 were duplicate records and 20,639 were excluded for reasons of irrelevance. The full text of 965 articles was retrieved for detailed assessment, following which 480 articles were excluded for various reasons. From the included articles, we retrieved 190 different CM zheng diagnoses from 485 individual studies. The most common zheng was dual deficiency of qi and blood (N = 48), which was diagnosed in 948 out of 15,740 subjects. The most frequently used classical formula was Ma-Zi-Ren-Wan (MZRW) (N = 75) and the most frequently used proprietary CHM was Run-Chang-Wan (N = 87). The most frequently used combined medication was Da Huang with sodium bicarbonate tablets (frequency across all studies, n = 23), followed by Fan Xie Ye with lactulose oral solution (n = 8), Ma-Ren-Ruan-Jiao-Nang with lactulose oral solution (n = 6) and Liu-Wei-An-Xiao-Jiao-Nang (n = 6) with mosapride citrate tablets. CONCLUSION: This study examined the use of CHM for constipation and summarized the herbs, formulae, proprietary medicines, and herb-drug interactions application. These data indicated there were limited information about herb-drug interactions and adverse effects of CHM and further randomized controlled trials with strict design are necessary.

27651817|t|Systematic Review on Chinese Herbal Medicine Induced Liver Injury.
27651817|a|Background. In recent years, with the popularity of CHM, its hepatotoxicity has also been increasingly noticed. However, there are still veils on causative herbs and clinical characteristics. Aim. To systematically review data on CHM induced liver injury with particular focus on causative herbs and clinical characteristics. Methods. Using terms related to CHM and liver injury, PubMed and three Chinese electronic databases were searched, which was limited to the past 5 years. Publications meeting our eligibility criteria were included and further analyzed. Results. In total, 4 single herbs, 21 patent drugs, and 4 decoctions were reported to be of hepatotoxicity, with He-Shou-Wu being the most common one (65/114). Dang-Gui and other 5 herbs were the most common ingredients of patent drugs and decoctions. All patients were assessed using the RUCAM scale, with 26 being highly probable and 28 being probable. For these 54 cases, the latent period was 30 (47) days, and 81.48% were labeled as hepatocellular injuries. Most patients (96.3%) recovered, apart from the fact that one died and one is receiving liver transplantation. Conclusions. CHM should be used carefully for hepatotoxicity. Liver injury from CHM is similar to that from conventional medicines in clinical characteristics. Details about causative herbs should be illustrated, and more RUCAM should be used in future.

27698262|t|Boehmenan, a Lignan From the Chinese Medicinal Plant Clematis armandii, Inhibits A431 Cell Growth via Blocking p70S6/S6 Kinase Pathway.
27698262|a|Previously, we have shown that boehmenan, a natural product isolated from the dried stem of Caulis clematidis armandii, exhibits various biological activities. The current study investigated the effects of boehmenan on the growth of human epidermoid carcinoma A431 cells. Cell viability and 50% inhibiting concentration (IC50) were assessed by CellTiter-Glo luminescent cell viability assay. Cell cycle arrest was measured by flow cytometry. Intracellular reactive oxygen species production and mitochondrial membrane potential (DeltaPsim) collapse were analyzed by a fluorescence spectrophotometer. The activation of epidermal growth factor receptor signaling pathway was evaluated by Western blot. The results showed that boehmenan significantly inhibited the growth of A431 cells (IC50 = 1.6 microM) in a concentration- and time-dependent manner. This compound also blocked cell cycle progression at G2/M phase and modulated mitochondrial apoptosis-related proteins, as evidenced by upregulating p21, cleaved caspase-3, and cleaved poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase protein levels and by downregulating Bcl-2, pro-caspase-9 levels. In addition, boehmenan also markedly induced intracellular reactive oxygen species production and DeltaPsim depolarization in a concentration-dependent manner. Furthermore, boehmenan-attenuated epidermal growth factor mediated the phosphorylation of signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3), p70 ribosomal protein S6 kinase (p70S6)/S6 in a concentration-dependent manner. Taken together, our results suggest that boehmenan-mediated antiproliferative property in A431 cells was mediated partially by modulation of mitochondrial function and inhibition of STAT3 and p70S6 signal pathways.

27774416|t|A randomized ethnomedicinal survey of snakebite treatment in southwestern parts of Bangladesh.
27774416|a|Snakebite is the single most important toxin-related injury, causing substantial mortality in many parts of the Africa, Asia and the Americas. Incidence of snakebite is usually recorded in young people engaged in active physical work in rural areas. The various plant parts used to treat snakebite included whole plant, leaves, barks, roots and seeds. Most bites in Bangladesh are recorded between May and October with highest number in June. Lower and upper limbs are most common sites of snakebite, but it may happen in other sites as well. Snake venom ( she du) has been the cause of innumerable deaths worldwide. However, antiserum does not provide enough protection against venom induced hemorrhage, necrosis, nephrotoxicity and hypersensitivity reactions. Informed consent was obtained from the practitioners prior to interviews. After the survey, it is concluded that the medicinal plants used by tribal medicinal practitioners in Bangladesh for treatment against snakebite are Acyranthes aspera L. ( tu niu xi), Amaranthus Viridis L. ( ye xiang cai), Asparagus racemosus Willd ( zong xu tian dong) and Emblica officinalis Gaertn ( you gan), while the non-tribal communities used 35 plant species among them, most of the plants reported as new species used against snakebite in the belonging family. The plants present a considerable potential for discovery of novel compounds with fewer side effects for treatment of antisnake venom and can, at least in Bangladesh, become a source of affordable and more easily available drugs.

27822287|t|Traditional Chinese Medicine Use among Patients with Psoriasis in Taiwan: A Nationwide Population-Based Study.
27822287|a|Traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) has long been used for patients with psoriasis. This study aimed to investigate TCM usage in patients with psoriasis. We analyzed a cohort of one million individuals representing the 23 million enrollees randomly selected from the National Health Insurance Research Database in Taiwan. We identified 28,510 patients newly diagnosed with psoriasis between 2000 and 2010. Among them, 20,084 (70.4%) patients were TCM users. Patients who were female, younger, white-collar workers and lived in urbanized area tended to be TCM users. The median interval between the initial diagnosis of psoriasis to the first TCM consultation was 12 months. More than half (N = 11,609; 57.8%) of the TCM users received only Chinese herbal medicine. Win-qing-yin and Bai-xian-pi were the most commonly prescribed Chinese herbal formula and single herb, respectively. The core prescription pattern comprised Mu-dan-pi, Wen-qing-yin, Zi-cao, Bai-xian-pi, and Di-fu-zi. Patients preferred TCM than Western medicine consultations when they had metabolic syndrome, hepatitis, rheumatoid arthritis, alopecia areata, Crohn's disease, cancer, depression, fatty liver, chronic airway obstruction, sleep disorder, and allergic rhinitis. In conclusion, TCM use is popular among patients with psoriasis in Taiwan. Future clinical trials to investigate its efficacy are warranted.

27990122|t|Chinese Herbal Medicine on Cardiovascular Diseases and the Mechanisms of Action.
27990122|a|Cardiovascular diseases are the principal cause of death worldwide. The potentially serious adverse effects of therapeutic drugs lead to growing awareness of the role of Chinese herbal medicine in the treatment of cardiovascular diseases. Chinese herbal medicine has been widely used in many countries especially in China from antiquity; however, the mechanisms by which herbal medicine acts in the prevention and treatment of cardiovascular diseases are far from clear. In this review, we briefly describe the characteristics of Chinese herbal medicine by comparing with western medicine. Then we summarize the formulae and herbs/natural products applied in the clinic and animal studies being sorted according to the specific cardiovascular diseases. Most importantly, we elaborate the existing investigations into mechanisms by which herbal compounds act at the cellular levels, including vascular smooth muscle cells, endothelial cells, cardiomyocytes and immune cells. Future research should focus on well-designed clinic trial, in-depth mechanic study, investigations on side effects of herbs and drug interactions. Studies on developing new agents with effectiveness and safety from traditional Chinese medicine is a promising way for prevention and treatment of patients with cardiovascular diseases.

28421029|t|A Historical View of Motion Sickness-A Plague at Sea and on Land, Also with Military Impact.
28421029|a|Seasickness and its triggers, symptoms, and preventive measures were well known in antiquity. This chapter is based on an analysis of descriptions of motion sickness, in particular seasickness, in ancient Greek, Roman, and Chinese literature. A systematic search was made from the Greek period beginning with Homer in 800 BC to the late Roman period and ending with Aetios Amidenos in 600 AD, as well as in the Chinese medical classics dating from around 300 AD. Major aspects are the following: body movements caused by waves were identified in all cultures as the critical stimuli. The ancient Greeks and Romans knew that other illnesses and the mental state could precipitate seasickness and that experienced sailors were highly resistant to it (habituation). The Chinese observed that children were particularly susceptible to motion sickness; they first described the type of motion sickness induced by traveling in carts (cart-sickness) or being transported on a litter or in a sedan chair (litter-sickness). The western classics recommended therapeutic measures like fasting or specific diets, pleasant fragrancies, medicinal plants like white hellebore (containing various alkaloids), or a mixture of wine and wormwood. The East knew more unusual measures, such as drinking the urine of young boys, swallowing white sand-syrup, collecting water drops from a bamboo stick, or hiding earth from the kitchen hearth under the hair. The Greek view of the pathophysiology of seasickness was based on the humoral theory of Empedokles and Aristoteles and differed from the Chinese medicine of correspondences, which attributed malfunctions to certain body substances and the life force Qi. Many sources emphasized the impact of seasickness on military actions and famous naval battles such as the Battle of the Red Cliff, which marked the end of the Han dynasty in China, or the defeat of the Spanish Armada by the English in 1588. A peculiar form of motion sickness is associated with Napoleon's camel corps during the Egyptian campaign of 1798/1799, a sickness induced by riding on a camel. Thus, motion sickness in antiquity was known as a physiological response to unadapted body motions during passive transportation as well as a plague at sea.

28798802|t|Prescribed Renoprotective Chinese Herbal Medicines Were Associated with a Lower Risk of All-Cause and Disease-Specific Mortality among Patients with Chronic Kidney Disease: A Population-Based Follow-Up Study in Taiwan.
28798802|a|Chinese herbal medicines (CHMs) containing aristolochic acid (AA) are associated with chronic kidney disease (CKD), but some prescribed CHMs have been shown to possess renoprotective effects. We conducted a nationwide retrospective cohort study to delineate the role of prescribed CHMs on the CKD progression. Renoprotective CHM (RPCHM) was defined if a CHM contained dong chong xia cao (Cordyceps sinensis (Berk.) Sacc.), da huang (Rheum palmatum L), huang qi (Astragalus membranaceus), dan shen (Salvia miltiorrhiza Bge.), and dong quai (Angelica sinensis (Oliv.) Diels) or belonged to specific mixture herbal formulations (Yishen capsule, Saireito, or Wen Pi Tang). Subjects who had ever used AA-containing CHMs, had cancer or HIV prior to CKD diagnosis, or died within the first month of CKD diagnosis were excluded. A total of 11,625 patients were eligible subjects. The adjusted hazard ratio (aHR) for all-cause mortality was 0.6 (p < 0.001) and 0.6 (p = 0.013) among subjects receiving RPCHMs containing Angelica sinensis and those receiving other RPCHMs, respectively. For CKD-related mortality, the aHR among subjects receiving RPCHMs containing Angelica sinensis was 0.6 (p = 0.025). The use of specific RPCHMs, especially those that contained Angelica sinensis, was associated with a lower risk of mortality among CKD patients.

29334976|t|Plants traditionally used to make Cantonese slow-cooked soup in China.
29334976|a|BACKGROUND: Lao huo liang tang (Cantonese slow-cooked soup, CSCS) is popular in Guangdong, China, and is consumed by Cantonese people worldwide as a delicious appetizer. Because CSCS serves as an important part of family healthcare, medicinal plants and plant-derived products are major components of CSCS. However, a collated record of the diverse plant species and an ethnobotanical investigation of CSCS is lacking. Because of globalization along with a renewed interest in botanical and food therapy, CSCS has attracted a growing attention in soup by industries, scientists, and consumers. This study represents the first attempt to document the plant species used for CSCS in Guangdong, China, and the associated ethnomedical function of plants, including their local names, part(s) used, flavors, nature, preparation before cooking, habitats, and conservation status. METHODS: In 2014-2017, participatory approaches, open-ended conversations, and semi-structured interviews were conducted with 63 local people and 48 soup restaurant owners (111 interviews) to better understand the biocultural context of CSCS, emphasizing ethnobotanical uses of plants in Guangdong Province, China. Product samples and voucher specimens were collected for taxonomic identification. Mention Index (QI), frequency of use index (FUI), and economic index (EI) were adopted to evaluate the significance of each plant in the food supply. RESULTS: A total of 97 plant species belonging to 46 families and 90 genera were recorded as having been used in CSCS in the study area. Recorded menus consisted of one or several plant species, with each one used for different purposes. They were classified into 11 functions, with clearing heat being the most common medicinal function. Of the 97 species, 19 grew only in the wild, 8 species were both wild and cultivated, and 70 species were cultivated. Roots and fruits were the most commonly used plant parts in the preparation of CSCS. According to the national evaluation criteria, six of these species are listed on "China's red list" including two endangered, two critically endangered, one near-threatened, and one vulnerable species. The QI, FUI, and EI of the 97 species in the study varied between 0.09 and 1, 0.23 and 9.95, and 0.45 and 6.58, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: As an important part of Cantonese culture, CSCS has been popularized as a local cuisine with a healthcare function. CSCS also reflects the plant species richness and cultural diversity of Guangdong Province. Future research on the safety and efficacy of CSCS as well as on ecological and cultural conservation efforts is needed for the sustainable growth of China's botanical and medicinal plant industry.

29373521|t|Detection of Abrin by Electrochemiluminescence Biosensor Based on Screen Printed Electrode.
29373521|a|For the convenience of fast measurement in the outdoor environment, a portable electrochemiluminescence biosensor with the screen-printed electrode as the reaction center was developed, which possesses the characteristics of high sensitivity, small scale, simplified operation and so on, and has been used for in situ detection of abrin. First, combining with magnetic separation technique, the "biotin-avidin" method was used to immobilize the polyclonal antibody (pcAb) on the magnetic microspheres surface as the capture probe. Secondly, the Ru(bpy)32+-labeled monoclonal antibody (mcAb) was used as the specific electrochemiluminescence signal probe. Then, the "mcAb-toxin-pcAb" sandwich model was built to actualize the quantitative detection of abrin on the surface of the screen-printed electrode. The linear detection range was 0.5-1000 ng/mL; the regression equation was Y = 89.251lgX + 104.978 (R = 0.9989, n = 7, p < 0.0001); and the limit of detection (LOD) was 0.1 ng/mL. The sensing system showed high sensitivity, excellent specificity and good anti-interference ability, and could be used for the analysis of trace abrin in various environmental samples with good recovery and reproducibility. Compared with the traditional electrochemiluminescence sensing device, its miniaturization and portability gives it potential to satisfy the requirement of in situ detection.

30363858|t|Utilization Pattern of Traditional Chinese Medicine among Fracture Patients: A Taiwan Hospital-Based Cross-Sectional Study.
30363858|a|Traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) divides fracture treatment into three stages. Many TCM herbs and formulas have been used to treat fractures for thousands of years. However, research regarding the Chinese herbal products (CHPs) that should be used at different periods of treatment is still lacking. This study aims to identify the CHPs that should be used at different periods of treatment as well as confirm the TCM theory of fracture periods medicine. We used prescriptions of TCM outpatients with fracture diagnoses analyzed using the Chang Gung Research Database (CGRD) from 2000 to 2015. According to the number of days between the date of the fracture and the clinic visit date, all patients were assigned to one of three groups. Patients with a date gap of 0-13 days were assigned to the early period group; those with a date gap of 14-82 days were assigned to the middle period group; and those with a date gap of 83-182 days were assigned to the late period group. We observed the average number of herbal formulas prescribed by the TCM doctor at each visit was 2.78, and the average number of single herbs prescribed was 6.47. The top three prescriptions in the early fracture period were Zheng-gu-zi-jin-dang, Shu-jing-huo-xue-tang, and Wu-ling-san. In the middle fracture period, the top three formulas were Zheng-gu-zi-jin-dang, Shu-jing-huo-xue-tang, and Zhi-bai-di-huang-wan. In the late fracture period, the top three formulas were Shu-jing-huo-xue-tang, Gui-lu-er-xian-jiao, and Du-huo-ji-sheng-tang. The main single herbs used in the early fracture period were Yan-hu-suo, Gu-sui-bu, and Dan-shen. From the middle to the late period, the most prescribed single herbs were Xu-duan, Gu-sui-bu, and Yan-hu-suo. We concluded that the results showed that the CGRD utilization pattern roughly meets the TCM theory at different fracture periods.

30655667|t|Phycocyanin/PEG-b-(PG-g-PEI) attenuated hepatic ischemia/reperfusion-induced pancreatic islet injury and enlarged islet functionality.
30655667|a|BACKGROUND: Hepatic ischemia/reperfusion-induced pancreatic islet injury (HI/RIPII) was an important pathophysiological phenomenon in clinics. In the present study, we observed the effects of phycocyanin on HI/RIPII. However, the half-life of phycocyanin was extremely short and limited its use in vivo. MATERIALS AND METHODS: In order to overcome this shortcoming, poly(ethylene glycol)-b-(poly(l-glutamic acid)-g-polyethylenimine) (PEG-b-(PG-g-PEI)) was synthesized and estimated as a nanocarrier for lengthening delivery of phycocyanin through the abdominal subcutaneous injection in rats. Phycocyanin (isoelectric point=4.3) was encapsulated with PEG-b-(PG-g-PEI) via electrostatic interactions at pH 7.4. RESULTS: In vitro phycocyanin was fast and efficiently encapsulated and showing efficient loading and sustained release. In vivo the anti-HI/RIPII function of phycocyanin/PEG-b-(PG-g-PEI) complex was surveyed in rats using free phycocyanin as the controls, and the results showed that phycocyanin/PEG-b-(PG-g-PEI) complex reduced HI/RIPII property and enlarged islet functionality. CONCLUSION: These results suggested that PEG-b-(PG-g-PEI) might be treated as a potential phycocyanin nanocarrier.

30937136|t|Trends and prescription patterns of traditional Chinese medicine use among subjects with allergic diseases: A nationwide population-based study.
30937136|a|BACKGROUND: The alarmingly rising prevalence of allergic diseases has led to substantial healthcare and economic burdens worldwide. The integrated use of traditional Chinese medicines (TCM) and Western medicines has been common in treating subjects with allergic diseases in clinical practice in Taiwan. However, limited studies have been conducted to evaluate long-term trends and prescription patterns of TCM use among subjects with allergic diseases. Thus, we conducted a nationwide population-based study to characterize TCM use among subjects with allergic diseases. METHODS: A total of 241,858 subjects with diagnosed atopic dermatitis, asthma or allergic rhinitis in the period of 2003-2012 were identified from the National Health Insurance Research Database (NHIRD) in Taiwan and included in this study. We assessed trends and prescribed patterns related to TCM (both single herbs and herbal formulas) among the study subjects over the 10-year study period. RESULTS: The overall proportions of TCM use were 30.5%, 29.0% and 45.7% in subjects with atopic dermatitis, asthma and allergic rhinitis, respectively. We found increasing trends of TCM use among subjects having atopic dermatitis and asthma, with annual increase of 0.91% and 0.38%, respectively, over the 10-year study period while the proportion remained steadily high (from 46.6% in 2003 to 46.3% in 2012) among subjects having allergic rhinitis. Moreover, the number of hospitalization due to allergic diseases in TCM users was significantly smaller than that in non TCM users for all three allergic diseases. CONCLUSION: A notable proportion (30%-50%) of subjects with allergic diseases in Taiwan has used TCM, with the highest proportion of TCM use found in subjects with allergic rhinitis, whereas increasing trends of TCM use are found among subjects with atopic dermatitis and asthma, respectively. Our results suggest that TCM use may help reduce the severe episodes of allergic diseases necessitating hospitalizations.

30987173|t|Fritillariae Thunbergii Bulbus: Traditional Uses, Phytochemistry, Pharmacodynamics, Pharmacokinetics and Toxicity.
30987173|a|Fritillariae Thunbergii Bulbus (FTB) has been widely used as an antitussive herb for thousands of years in China. However, FTB's traditional uses, chemical compounds and pharmacological activities have not been systematically reviewed. This study aimed to review its traditional uses, phytochemistry, pharmacodynamics, pharmacokinetics and toxicity. We searched the Encyclopedia of Traditional Chinese Medicine to explore the historical records which indicate that it acts to clear heat, resolve phlegm, relieve cough, remove toxicity and disperse abscesses and nodules. We searched 11 databases to identify potential phytochemical or pharmacological studies. Characteristics of its chemical constituents, pharmacological effects, pharmacokinetic and toxicity were descriptively summarized. A total of 9706 studies were identified and 83 of them were included. As a result, 134 chemical constituents were identified, including 26 alkaloids, 29 compounds found in essential oils, 13 diterpenoids, two carbohydrates, two sterols, 18 amino acids, six nucleosides, four nucleobases, four fatty acids, three lignans, and 27 elements. Thirteen pharmacological effects of FTB were identified, including anti-cancer, tracheobronchial relaxation, antitussive, expectorant, anti-muscarinic, anti-inflammation, anti-thyroid, regulation of blood rheology, antiulcer, anti-diarrhea, pain suppression, antioxidation and neuroprotection. These pharmacological activities may be mainly attributed to the alkaloids in FTB. Further phytochemical, pharmacological and network pharmacological studies are recommended.

31068976|a|Cyathulae Radix (CR), also known as "Chuanniux" is a well-known traditional Chinese herbal medicine that has been used in China for thousands of years. The present work reviewed advances in traditional uses, origin, chemical constituents, pharmacology, pharmacokinetics, and toxicity studies of CR. This work aims to provide more up-to-date references for modern study and application of this plant. Furthermore, the possible trends and perspectives for future research of this plant are also discussed. In China, the roots of CR have been widely used in clinical practice to treat orthopedic, gynecological, and urologic diseases. Currently, over 59 compounds have been isolated and identified from CR, including alkaloids and flavonoids. The extracts and compounds from CR have many pharmacological activities both in vivo and in vitro. They provide beneficial effects on the hematological system and anti-inflammatory properties. However, few studies have investigated the pharmacokinetics and toxicity of CR. Further studies should be undertaken to investigate the clinical effects, toxic constituents, and pharmacokinetics of CR; perform quality evaluation; and establish quality criteria for processed C. officinalis. Furthermore, studying the changes of raw and processed CR and the variety of this plant between different cultivated areas and cultivars will be interesting.

31316387|t|Add-On Effects of Chinese Herbal Medicine for Post-Stroke Spasticity: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis.
31316387|a|Background: Treatment for post-stroke spasticity (PSS) remains a major challenge in clinical practice. Chinese herbal medicine (CHM) is often administered to assist in routine care (RC) in the treatment of PSS, with increasing numbers of clinical research and preclinical studies suggesting that it has potential benefits. Therefore, we conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis to evaluate the add-on effects and safety of CHM for PSS. Methods: Five English and four Chinese databases were searched from their respective inception to 28 February 2018. We included randomized controlled trials that evaluated the add-on effects of CHM for PSS, based on changes in the scores of the (Modified) Ashworth Scale (AS or MAS), Fugl-Meyer Assessment of Sensorimotor Recovery (FMA), and Barthel Index (BI). Results: Thirty-five trials involving 2,457 patients were included. For upper-limb AS or MAS, the estimated add-on effects of CHM to RC were significantly better when using oral (SMD -1.79, 95% CI: -3.00 to -0.57) or topical CHM (SMD -1.06, 95% CI: -1.40 to -0.72). For lower-limb AS or MAS, significant add-on benefits to RC were also detected (SMD -1.01, 95% CI: -1.43 to -0.59 and SMD -1.16, 95% CI: -1.83 to -0.49) using oral and topical CHM, respectively. For FMA and BI, better results were detected when adding CHM to RC, except for the subgroup of oral CHM for upper-limb FMA. Ten of the 35 included studies reported safety information, with two of them mentioning two mild adverse events. Conclusions: Noting the quality concerns of the included trials, this review suggests that CHM appears to be a well-tolerated therapy for patients with PSS, and the potential add-on effects of CHM in reducing spasticity and improving the daily activities of patients with PSS require further rigorous assessment.

31649859|t|Herbal formula (Danggui Beimu Kushen Wan) for prostate disorders: a systematic review of classical literature.
31649859|a|BACKGROUND: Danggui Beimu Kushen Wan (DBKW) was initially known for difficult urination in pregnancy and has been widely used for prostate disorders in modern days. This study aimed to comprehensively investigate the implications of DBKW in traditional evidence. METHODS: The Encyclopedia of Traditional Chinese Medicine was searched to identify the ingredients, dosage, etiologies, pathogeneses, actions and indications related to DBKW documented in ancient books. Descriptive summary was provided to their characteristics. RESULTS: A total of 41 texts in 36 classic books were included. Two etiologies and 10 pathogeneses were investigated. All the identified formulas contain Angelicae Sinensis Radix, Fritillariae Thunbergii Bulbus and Sophorae Flavescentis Radix with the ratio of 1:1:1. The treatment dosage is three to 10 pills each time. The primary indication of DBKW is difficult urination with heat stagnation. Nine included texts specified that this formula could also be used for male. CONCLUSION: Included classic literature has provided fundamental evidence for the management of difficult urination in female and male. Further studies should investigate its mechanisms of actions for difficult urination related conditions, such as prostate disorders.

32102675|t|An ethnobotanical survey of wild edible plants used by the Yi people of Liangshan Prefecture, Sichuan Province, China.
32102675|a|BACKGROUND: Due to historical perceptions of Liangshan Yi Autonomous Prefecture (Sichuan Province, China) as being a violent place, and due to its rugged terrain, cultural differences, and relative inaccessibility, few researchers have conducted in-depth ethnobotanical investigations in Liangshan. But wild edible plants (WEPs) are widely consumed by the Yi people of Liangshan, and their associated ethnobotanical knowledge remains relatively unknown, especially outside of China. This study aimed to (1) investigate the WEPs used by the Liangshan Yi, (2) document the traditional knowledge held about these plants, (3) analyze their special preparation methods and consumption habits, and (4) identify species with important cultural significance to the Liangshan Yi. METHODS: During 2016-2017, 396 Yi individuals were interviewed in 1 county-level city and 6 counties across Liangshan. Prior informed consent was obtained, and multiple ethnographic methods were utilized, including direct observation, semi-structured interviews, key informant interviews, informal discussions, and field visits. Market surveys were conducted in April, July, and August 2017 by interviewing 38 Yi merchants selling WEPs in 6 Liangshan traditional markets. We collected information about the parts consumed, preparation methods, consumption habits, growth pattern of species, collection months, market prices, and other uses of WEPs. Use values (UVs) were calculated to analyze the relative cultural importance of each WEP. RESULTS: In total, 105 plant species belonging to 97 genera and 62 families were recorded. Rosaceae was the family with the largest number of species (14), and herbs (58 species) were the dominant growth form reported. Fruits (34 species), roots (21 species), and tender shoots (20 species) were the primary plant parts used for snacking and cooking. There were 6 main preparation and consumption methods of WEPs reported, ranging from primary food, famine food, snack, spice, culinary coagulant, and medicine, among a few other uses. The Liangshan Yi mainly collect WEPs from March to October, seldom collecting from November to February. There were 35 species of WEPs sold in the markets we visited in Liangshan. The price of medicinal plants was much higher than the price of food and fruits. In total, we documented 49 species of edible medicinal plants in Liangshan, accounting for 44.7% of all WEPs. They can be used for treating 27 medical conditions, including cough, diarrhea, injury, and headaches. The plants with the highest UVs were Berberis jamesiana (1.92), Pyracantha fortuneana (1.87), and Artemisia capillaris (1.44) indicating that these species are the most commonly used and important to the Liangshan Yi's traditional life and culture. CONCLUSIONS: The traditional knowledge of WEPs from the accumulated experience of the Yi people's long period residing in Liangshan reflects the cultural richness of the Yi and the plant diversity of the region. Future research on the nutrition, chemical composition, and bioactivity of the WEPs are needed. Some species with high medicinal value but with sharp wild population decline should be surveyed for resource assessment, conservation, and domestication potential.

32194408|t|Adjunctive Chinese Herbal Products Therapy Reduces the Risk of Ischemic Stroke Among Patients With Rheumatoid Arthritis.
32194408|a|We performed a retrospective cohort study to investigate the association between the risk of ischemic stroke (IS) and the use of Chinese herbal products (CHP) in combination with western medicine (WM) among patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA). The data were sourced from the registry for beneficiaries, inpatient and ambulatory care claims, and Registry for Catastrophic Illness from the National Health Insurance Research Database (NHIRD) in Taiwan between 1997 and 2011. Patients, who were newly diagnosed with RA between 1997 and 2010, were classified as the CHP group or non-CHP group depending on the presence of absence the adjunctive use of CHP following a diagnosis of RA. A total of 4,148 RA patients were in both the CHP and non-CHP groups after 1:1 matching. Patients in the CHP group had a significantly lower risk of IS compared to patients in the non-CHP group (adjusted hazard ratio [aHR], 0.67; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.52-0.86). In the CHP group, patients who used CHP for more than 30 days had a lower risk of IS than their counterparts (aHR: 0.61, 95% CI: 0.40-0.91). Gui-Zhi-Shao-Yao-Zhi-Mu-Tang, Shu-Jin-Huo-Xie-Tang, and Du-Huo-Ji-Sheng-Tang might be associated with a lower risk of IS. Finally, the use of CHP in combination with WM was associated with a decreased risk of IS in patients with RA, especially among those who had used CHP for more than 30 days. A further randomized control trial is required to clarify the casual relationship between these results.

32280208|t|Association of Chinese Herbal Medicines Use with Development of Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease Among Patients with Rheumatoid Arthritis: A Population-Based Cohort Study.
32280208|a|Purpose: Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) patients appear to report a higher risk of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). While Chinese herbal medicine (CHMs) is proven to lower COPD risk, the scientific evidence regarding its effect in relation to COPD onset among them is limited. This longitudinal cohort study aimed to determine the relationship between CHMs use and the COPD risk in RA patients. Methods: Using the nationwide claim data, 8349 patients newly diagnosed with RA and simultaneously free of COPD between 1998 and 2010 were eligible for enrollment. From this sample, we enrolled 3360 CHMs users and 3360 non-CHMs users, randomly selected using propensity scores matching from the remaining cases. They were followed until the end of 2012 to record COPD incidence. The hazard ratio (HR) of COPD with regard to CHMs use was estimated by the Cox proportional hazards regression model. Results: In the follow-up period, 136 CHMs users and 202 non-CHMs users developed COPD, representing incidence rates of 5.16 and 7.66, respectively, per 1000 person-years. CHMs use was associated with a 32% lower subsequent risk of COPD (adjusted HR: 0.68, 95% Confidence Interval: 0.54-0.84). Eight commonly prescribed CHMs were discovered to be associated with lower COPD risk: Yan Hu Suo, Sang Zhi, Dang Shen, Huang Qin, Jia-Wei-Xiao-Yao-San, Shu-Jing-Huo-Xue-Tang, Du-Huo-Ji-Sheng-Tang and Ge-Gen-Tang. Conclusion: A significant association of CHMs use with a lower risk of COPD onset in RA patients was found, suggesting that CHMs could be integrated into conventional therapy to reduce COPD risk.

32358395|t|Association rule mining for the ordered placement of traditional Chinese medicine containers: An experimental study.
32358395|a|In traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) clinics, the pharmacists responsible for dispensing the herbal medicine usually find the desired ingredients based on positions of the shelves (racks; frames; stands). Generally, these containers are arranged in an alphabetical order depending on the herbal medicine they contain. However, certain related ingredients tend to be used together in many prescriptions, even though the containers may be stored far away from each other. This can cause problems, especially when there are many patients and/or the limited number of pharmacists. If the dispensing time takes longer, it is likely to impact the satisfaction of the patients' experience. Moreover, the stamina of the pharmacists will be consumed quickly.In this study, we investigate on an association rule mining technology to improve efficiency in TCM dispensing based on the frequent pattern growth algorithm and try to identify which 2 or 3 herbal medicines will match together frequently in prescriptions. Furthermore, 3 experimental studies are conducted based on a dataset collected from a traditional Chinese medicine hospital. The dataset includes information for an entire year (2014), including 4 seasons and doctors. Afterward, a questionnaire on the usefulness of the extracted rules was administered to the pharmacists in the case hospital. The responses showed the mining results to be very valuable as a reference for the placement and ordering of the frames in the TCM pharmacies and drug stores.

32372963|t|Chinese Herbal Medicine and Its Regulatory Effects on Tumor Related T Cells.
32372963|a|Traditional Chinese medicine is an accepted and integral part of clinical cancer management alongside Western medicine in China. However, historically TCM physicians were unaware of the chemical constituents of their formulations, and the specific biological targets in the body. Through HPLC, flow cytometry, and other processes, researchers now have a much clearer picture of how herbal medicine works in conjunction with the immune system in cancer therapy. Among them, the regulation of tumor-related T cells plays the most important role in modulating tumor immunity by traditional Chinese medicine. Encouraging results have been well-documented, including an increase in T cell production along with their associated cytokines, enhanced regulation of Tregs and important T cell ratios, the formation and function of Tregs in tumor microenvironments, and the promotion of the number and function of normal T Cells to reduce conventional cancer therapy side effects. Chinese herbal medicine represents a rich field of research from which to draw further inspiration for future studies. While promising agents have already been identified, the vast majority of Chinese herbal mechanisms remain undiscovered. In this review, we summarize the effects and mechanisms of specific Chinese herbs and herbal decoctions on tumor related T cells.

32419824|t|Chinese Herbal Medicines for Rheumatoid Arthritis: Text-Mining the Classical Literature for Potentially Effective Natural Products.
32419824|a|BACKGROUND: Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is an autoimmune disease characterized by multijoint swelling, pain, and destruction of the synovial joints. Treatments are available but new therapies are still required. One source of new therapies is natural products, including herbs used in traditional medicines. In China and neighbouring countries, natural products have been used throughout recorded history and are still in use for RA and its symptoms. This study used text-mining of a database of classical Chinese medical books to identify candidates for future clinical and experimental investigations of therapeutics for RA. METHODS: The database Encyclopaedia of Traditional Chinese Medicine (Zhong Hua Yi Dian) includes the full texts of over 1,150 classical books. Eight traditional terms were searched. All citations were assessed for relevance to RA. Results and Conclusions. After removal of duplications, 3,174 citations were considered. After applying the exclusion and inclusion criteria, 548 citations of traditional formulas were included. These derived from 138 books written from 206 CE to 1948. These formulas included 5,018 ingredients (mean, 9 ingredients/formula) comprising 243 different natural products. When these text-mining results were compared to the 18 formulas recommended in a modern Chinese Medicine clinical practice guideline, 44% of the herbal formulas were the same. This suggests considerable continuity in the clinical application of these herbs between classical and modern Chinese medicine practice. Of the 15 herbs most frequently used as ingredients of the classical formulas, all have received research attention, and all have been reported to have anti-inflammatory effects. Two of these 15 herbs have already been developed into new anti-RA therapeutics-sinomenine from Sinomenium acutum (Thunb.) Rehd. & Wils and total glucosides of peony from Paeonia lactiflora Pall. Nevertheless, there remains considerable scope for further research. This text-mining approach was effective in identifying multiple natural product candidates for future research.

32527065|t|Reduced Stroke Risk among Patients with Atrial Fibrillation Receiving Chinese Herbal Medicines Treatment: Analysis of Domestic Data in Taiwan.
32527065|a|Background and objectives: Patients with atrial fibrillation (AF) reportedly have a much higher risk of death due to stroke. Faced with this heavy burden, it remains unclear if the Chinese herbal medicines (CHMs), the most common form complementary and alternative medicine, can lower the risk of stroke for them. This study aimed to evaluate the association of CHMs use with stroke risk among them. MATERIALS AND METHODS: From a nationwide database, 11,456 AF patients aged   20 years between 1998 and 2007 were identified. Afterwards, we enrolled 2670 CHMs users and randomly selected 2670 non-CHMs users using the propensity score method. The occurrence of stroke was recorded until the end of 2012. RESULTS: Within the follow-up period, 671 CHMs users and 900 non-CHMs users developed stroke, with incidence rates of 33.02 and 45.46 per 1000 person-years, respectively. CHMs use was associated with a 30% lower stroke risk, especially for those receiving CHMs for over two years. CONCLUSIONS: The findings of the present study suggest that adding CHMs to conventional therapy could decrease subsequent stroke risk for AF patients. It is also suggested that prospective randomized trials are needed to further clarify if the detected association revealed in this study supports a causal link, and to identify the specific CHMs that may be beneficial to AF patients.

32834949|t|Analysis on herbal medicines utilized for treatment of COVID-19.
32834949|a|As coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic poses a substantial global public health threat, traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) was used in 91.50% of the COVID-19 cases in China, showing encouraging results in improving symptom management and reducing the deterioration, mortality, and recurrence rates. A total of 166 modified herbal formulae consisting of 179 single herbal medicines were collected for treating COVID-19 in China. Glycyrrhizae Radix et Rhizome, Scutellariae Radix, and Armeniacae Semen Amarum are the most frequently utilized in clinics, most of which are antipyretic (47, 26.26%), expectorant and cough-suppressing (22, 12.29%), and dampness-resolving (21, 11.73%) from traditional descriptions. A total of 1212 chemical components containing beta-sitosterol, stigmasterol, and quercetin were primarily selected. Additionally, using complex system entropy and unsupervised hierarchical clustering, 8 core herbal combinations and 10 new formulae emerged as potentially useful candidates for COVID-19. Finally, following scaffold analysis, self-organizing mapping (SOM) and cluster analysis, 12 clusters of molecules yielded 8 pharmacophore families of structures that were further screened as pharmacological targets in human metabolic pathways for inhibiting coronavirus. This article aims to make more easily accessible and share historical herbal knowledge used in contemporary treatments in a modern manner to assist researchers contain the global spread of COVID-19.

33163337|t|Nature-derived compounds modulating Wnt/ beta -catenin pathway: a preventive and therapeutic opportunity in neoplastic diseases.
33163337|a|The Wnt/beta-catenin signaling is a conserved pathway that has a crucial role in embryonic and adult life. Dysregulation of the Wnt/beta-catenin pathway has been associated with diseases including cancer, and components of the signaling have been proposed as innovative therapeutic targets, mainly for cancer therapy. The attention of the worldwide researchers paid to this issue is increasing, also in view of the therapeutic potential of these agents in diseases, such as Parkinson's disease (PD), for which no cure is existing today. Much evidence indicates that abnormal Wnt/beta-catenin signaling is involved in tumor immunology and the targeting of Wnt/beta-catenin pathway has been also proposed as an attractive strategy to potentiate cancer immunotherapy. During the last decade, several products, including naturally occurring dietary agents as well as a wide variety of products from plant sources, including curcumin, quercetin, berberin, and ginsenosides, have been identified as potent modulators of the Wnt/beta-catenin signaling and have gained interest as promising candidates for the development of chemopreventive or therapeutic drugs for cancer. In this review we make an overview of the nature-derived compounds reported to have antitumor activity by modulating the Wnt/beta-catenin signaling, also focusing on extraction methods, chemical features, and bio-activity assays used for the screening of these compounds.

33173434|t|Herbal plants coordinate COVID-19 in multiple dimensions - An insight analysis for clinically applied remedies.
33173434|a|The use of multipronged measures, including traditional Chinese medicine (TCM), has greatly increased in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, and we found the use of TCM and is positively correlated with the regional cure rate in China (R=0.77, P<10-5). We analyzed 185 commonly administered TCM recipes comprised of 210 herbs nationwide to reveal mechanistic insight. Eight out of the 10 most commonly used herbs showed anti-coronavirus potential by intersecting with COVID-19 targets. Intriguingly, 17 compounds from the 5 most commonly used herbs were revealed to have direct anti-SARS-CoV-2 potential by docking with the two core structures [CoV spike (S) glycoprotein (6SVB) and CoV 3CL hydrolase (6LU7)]. Seven reported COVID-19 drugs served as positive controls; among them, retionavir (-7.828 kcal/mol) and remdesivir (-8.738 kcal/mol) performed best with 6VSB and 6LU7, respectively. The top candidate was madreselvin B (6SVB: -8.588 kcal/mol and 6LU7: -9.017 kcal/mol), an appreciable component of Flos Lonicerae. Eighty-six compounds from 22 unlisted herbs were further identified among 2,042 natural compounds, completing our arsenal for TCM formulations. The mechanisms have been implicated as multifactorial, including activation of immunoregulation (Th2, PPAR and IL10), suppression of acute inflammatory responses (IL-6, IL-1alpha/beta, TNF, COX2/1, etc.), enhancement of antioxidative activity (CAT and SOD1), and modulation of apoptosis (inhibited CASP3). It is of interest to understand the biological mechanisms of TCM recipes. We then analyzed 18 representative remedies based on molecular targets associated with 14 medical conditions over the disease course, e.g., pyrexia, coughing, asthenia, lymphopenia, cytokine storm, etc. The significant level of coherence (SLC) revealed, in part, the potential uses and properties of corresponding TCMs. Thus, herbal plants coordinate to combat COVID-19 in multiple dimensions, casting a light of hope before effective vaccines are developed.

33316957|t|Impact of Environmental Regulation on Scientific and Technological Competitiveness of Resource-Based Cities in China-Based on Panel Data of 33 Resource-Based Cities.
33316957|a|After the economy enters a "new normal" era in China, resource-based cities are under pressure in terms of transformation, upgrading and sustainable development. This paper uses the panel data of 33 resource-based cities from 2008 to 2018 to empirically analyze the impact of environmental regulation and innovation compensation on scientific and technological competitiveness. The results show that there is a positive U-shaped relation between environmental regulation and scientific and technological competitiveness. This means that when environmental regulations exceed a certain level, continuing to increase regulations will significantly enhance technological competitiveness, but most samples are still on the left side of the turning point. At the same time, the labor productivity and fiscal capacity of non-agricultural industries in the region may have a strong regulatory effect. In a region with higher labor productivity in non-agricultural industries or stronger local fiscal capacity, environmental regulation is more likely to reflect the attribute of "innovation compensation" and advance scientific and technological competitiveness. At this stage, we should optimize the trans-regional compensation mechanism for resource-rich regions, increase investment in pollution management and ecological protection and impose stricter admission standards on industrial projects. Besides, skilled laborers should be cultivated and innovation and entrepreneurship be supported to realize the green and sustainable development of resource-based cities in the new era.




33424985|t|Oral Chinese Herbal Medicine as Prophylactic Treatment for Episodic Migraine in Adults: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis of Randomized Controlled Trials.
33424985|a|BACKGROUND: The prophylactic effects of Chinese herbal medicine (CHM) for migraine were examined in numerous clinical trials. This review aimed to analyze the effectiveness and safety of CHM as prophylactic treatment of migraine compared to flunarizine. METHODS: Nine databases were searched for randomized controlled trials (RCTs) that evaluated effects of CHM for episodic migraine prophylaxis compared to flunarizine, published before March 2019. RESULTS: Thirty-five RCTs with 2,840 participants met the inclusion criteria, and 31 of them were included in meta-analyses. The overall meta-analysis indicated that, when compared to flunarizine, CHM reduced the frequency of migraine attacks at the end of treatment (EoT) (21 studies, mean difference (MD) -1.23, 95% confidence interval (CI) (-1.69, -0.76)) and at the end of follow-up (EoFU) (five studies, MD -0.96, 95% CI (-1.70, -0.21)). Subgroup analyses based on the treatment duration, follow-up duration, and the dosage of flunarizine showed that CHM was superior to or comparable with flunarizine in reducing migraine frequency. Similar results were also found for secondary outcomes such as the pain visual analogue scale, migraine duration, responder rate, and acute medication usage. In particular, the studies that used CHM containing herb pairs (Chuan Xiong plus Bai Zhi and Chuan Xiong plus Tian Ma) showed promising results. However, the certainty of this evidence was evaluated as "low" or "very low" using the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluations approach. CONCLUSION: CHM appeared to be comparable with flunarizine in reducing the frequency of episodic migraine attacks in adults at EoT and EoFU and well-tolerated by participants, regardless of the treatment duration, follow-up duration, and dosage of flunarizine. Due to the low certainty of the evidence, the suggested promising prophylactic outcomes require higher quality evidence from further rigorous RCTs.

33757555|t|Ethnobotanical study on herbal market at the Dragon Boat Festival of Chuanqing people in China.
33757555|a|BACKGROUND: The Chuanqing people () are a linguistic group native to the Guizhou Province of China, with unique culture and rich knowledge of traditional medicinal plants. Herbal market at Dragon Boat Festival (DBF) plays an important role in the inheritance of traditional medicinal knowledge among the Chuanqing people. This study aims to record the profile of medicinal plants of the Chuanqing people, discuss the dilemmas faced by their inheritance, and propose some strategies for passing down information, which is critical for the inheritance and protection of the Chuanqing people's traditional medical knowledge. METHODS: Data were collected through key informants and semi-structured interviews and free listing. Collected voucher specimens were identified using by botanical taxonomy method and deposited in the herbarium. Data were analyzed through use-value (UV) and cultural importance index (CI) values. Medicinal plants were compared with the Information System of Chinese Rare and Endangered Plants of the Chinese Academy of Sciences. Results were compared with the Pharmacopoeia of the People's Republic of China (ChP), the Quality Standard of Traditional Chinese Medicine and National Medicine in Guizhou Province (QSG), and traditional medicines of Southeast Asian countries. RESULTS: A total of 102 species from 53 families and 92 genera were recorded, with Orchidaceae and Asparagaceae (six species each), and Berberidaceae and Asteraceae (five species each) as the predominant families. The whole plant (36%) was the most common medicinal part. Decoction (44%) was the most common preparation method. Seventy-one investigated human ailments were grouped into 12 categories. Diseases of the musculoskeletal system (34 mentions) were most frequently mentioned in this study. Moreover, the most frequently used taxon was Hedera sinensis (Tobler ) Hand.-Mazz. (UV and CI = 0.29). The Chuanqing people's medicine was highly similar to ChP and QSG. In comparison with Southeast Asian countries' traditional medicines, except for the same preparation methods, the similarities in terms of medicinal ingredients, plants, and disease treatment were very low. CONCLUSIONS: The herbal market at the DBF is an important platform for exchanging knowledge about the Chuanqing people's traditional medicinal plants. The Chuanqing people's traditional medicine is facing many challenges to its inheritance and development. To solve these problems, this study highlights the traditional medicinal knowledge of the Chuanqing people, providing basic data for further research and protection of minority medicine.

33910734|t|Chitosan coated pH-responsive metal-polyphenol delivery platform for melanoma chemotherapy.
33910734|a|The safe and effective drug delivery system is important for cancer therapy. Here in, we first constructed a delivery system Cabazitaxel(Cab)@MPN/CS between metal-polyphenol (MPN) and chitosan (CS) to deliver Cab for melanoma therapy. The preparation process is simple, green, and controllable. After introducing CS coating, the drug loading was improved from 7.56 % to 9.28 %. Cab@MPN/CS NPs released Cab continuously under acid tumor microenvironment. The zeta potential of Cab@MPN/CS NPs could be controlled by changing the ratio of Cab@MPN and CS solutions. The positively charged Cab@MPN/CS accelerate B16F10 cell internalization. After internalized, Cab@MPN/CS NPs could escape from lysosomes via the proton sponge effect. The permeability of CS promotes the penetration of Cab@MPN/CS to the deeper B16F10 tumor spheroids. In vivo results showed that Cab@MPN/CS NPs have a longer retention time in tumor tissues and significantly inhibit tumor growth by up-regulating TUNEL expression and down-regulating KI67 and CD31 expression. Thus, this delivery system provides a promising strategy for the tumor therapy in clinic.

33926492|t|Ethnobiological study on traditional medicinal plants and fungi recorded in the Naxi Dongba sutras.
33926492|a|BACKGROUND: The Naxi people, living in Southwest China, have a long history and rich characteristic culture. Their ancestors recorded their life practices by ancient hieroglyphs and gradually formed the Dongba Sutras, which, among other knowledge, included the traditional knowledge of Naxi medicine. In the past, most studies on the Dongba Sutras focused on the humanistic culture of Naxi people, whereas studies have rarely focused on Naxi herbal medicinal plants and fungi described in the Dongba Sutras. Studying this aspect is helpful for exploring the traditional culture of Naxi people from the perspective of traditional medicine. METHODS: From February to September 2019, we screened the medicinal plants and fungi from the Dongba Sutras with the help of Dongba. Then, we carried out field investigations and collected voucher specimens of traditional medicinal plants and fungi with the help of 104 Naxi folk healers. The specimens were identified and stored in the Herbarium of Yunnan Branch, Institute of Medicinal Plants, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences (IMDY). Through semi-structured interviews, we obtained ethnobotanical information of medicinal plants and fungi. The obtained quantitative data were analyzed using the informant consensus factor (ICF) method and the number of citations. RESULTS: A total of 85 species of medicinal plants and fungi belonging to 51 families and 71 genera were recorded in the Dongba Sutras. Among them, 25 species were endemic to China, and eight species were only distributed in Naxi distribution areas. These medicinal plants and fungi were mainly obtained from the wild, and 22 species could be used as food. The most frequent method of taking medicinal materials was oral-taking after decoction, followed by topical and sometimes buccal. The methods of processing these medicinal materials included water decoction, warm water flushing, and drinking after soaking. The medicinal plants and fungi in the Dongba Sutras are used to treat 96 conditions classified into 13 disease groups according to the International Classification of Primary Care second edition. Further analysis indicated that most of these species were utilized for treating diseases from the digestive (D) group, followed by those from the respiratory (R) group, musculoskeletal (L) group, general, and unspecified (A) group. Moreover, the Naxi people have a high consensus on the treatments of diseases from these four pathological groups. CONCLUSIONS: The Naxi traditional medicine is characterized by simple materials, easy operation, and distinctive national characteristics. The ancient Naxi people recorded their highly developed medical culture in the Dongba Sutras. Natural plant resources found around them were their primary choices for both medicine and diet therapy. The ecological ethics of Naxi people have positive significance for the conservation of wild resources in their area.

33986820|t|The Efficacy of Complementary and Alternative Medicine in the Treatment of Female Infertility.
33986820|a|Female infertility is a state of fertility disorder caused by multiple reasons. The incidence of infertility for females has significantly increased due to various factors such as social pressure, late marriage, and late childbirth, and its harm includes heavy economic burden, psychological shadow, and even marriage failure. Conventional solutions, such as hormone therapy, in vitro fertilization (IVF), and embryo transfer, have the limitations of unsatisfied obstetric outcomes and serious adverse events. Currently, complementary and alternative medicine (CAM), as a new treatment for infertility, is gradually challenging the dominant position of traditional therapies in the treatment of infertility. CAM claims that it can adjust and harmonize the state of the female body from a holistic approach to achieve a better therapeutic effect and has been increasingly used by infertile women. Meanwhile, some controversial issues also appeared; that is, some randomized controlled trials (RCTs) confirmed that CAM had no obvious effect on infertility, and the mechanism of its effect could not reach a consensus. To clarify CAM effectiveness, safety, and mechanism, this paper systematically reviewed the literature about its treatment of female infertility collected from PubMed and CNKI databases and mainly introduced acupuncture, moxibustion, and oral Chinese herbal medicine. In addition, we also briefly summarized psychological intervention, biosimilar electrical stimulation, homeopathy, hyperbaric oxygen therapy, etc.

34306150|t|Complementary and Alternative Medicine for Dysmenorrhea Caused by Endometriosis: A Review of Utilization and Mechanism.
34306150|a|Endometriosis (EM) is a common and benign estrogen-dependent gynecological disorder among women of reproductive age, and secondary dysmenorrhea is one of the more severe symptoms. However, the mechanism behind the development of dysmenorrhea is poorly understood, and there is a lack of effective methods for diagnosing and treating EM dysmenorrhea. In this regard, complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) has recently come into widespread use due to its limited adverse reactions and high efficiency. This review updates the progress of CAM in the treatment of EM dysmenorrhea and seeks to identify the therapeutic efficacy as well as the mechanisms behind these effects based on the available clinical and experimental studies. According to the literature, CAM therapy for EM dysmenorrhea, including herbs (herbal prescriptions, extracts, and patents), acupuncture, and Chinese herbal medicine enema (CHM enema), is effective for relieving dysmenorrhea with fewer unpleasant side effects when compared to hormonal and surgical treatments. In addition, we discuss and analyze the existing gaps in the literature. We hope to provide some instructive suggestions for clinical treatment and experimental research in the future.

34355003|t|Effect of Chinese Herbal Medicines on Hearing Loss Risk in Rheumatoid Arthritis Patients: Retrospective Claims Analysis.
34355003|a|Objectives: Patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) are at a higher risk of extra-articular manifestations, especially hearing loss (HL). Although Chinese herbal medicines (CHM) are proven safe and effective treatments for inflammatory conditions, the effect of CHM use on HL in RA patients is unknown. This cohort study aims to determine the relationship between CHM use and the subsequent risk of HL among RA patients. Methods: From health insurance claims data in Taiwan, a total of 6,905 persons aged 20-80 years with newly-diagnosed RA in 2000-2009 were identified. Of these, we recruited 2,765 CHM users and randomly selected 2,765 non-CHM users who matched with the users by the propensity score. Both cohorts were followed up until the end of 2012 to estimate the incidence of HL. Cox proportional hazards regression was used to estimate the adjusted hazard ratio (HR) for HL. Results: The incidence of HL was lower in the CHM users than in the comparison cohort (8.06 vs. 10.54 per 1,000 person-years) (adjusted HR, 0.77; 95% CI, 0.63-0.94). Those who received CHM for more than 2 years had the greatest benefit against the onset of HL, with over 50% risk reduction. Prescriptions of Hai Piao Xiao, Yan Hu Suo, San-Qi, Huang Qin, Dang Shen, Jia-Wei-Xiao-Yao-San, Shu-Jing-Huo-Xue-Tang, and Dang-Gui-Nian-Tong-Tang were found to be associated with a reduced risk of HL. Conclusions: Our findings suggest that adding CHM to conventional therapy may reduce the subsequent risk of HL in RA patients. Prospective randomized trials are recommended to further clarify whether the association revealed in this study supports such a causal relationship.

34721646|t|Advances in Experimental and Clinical Research of the Gouty Arthritis Treatment with Traditional Chinese Medicine.
34721646|a|Gouty arthritis (GA) is a multifactorial disease whose pathogenesis is utterly complex, and the current clinical treatment methods cannot wholly prevent GA development. Western medicine is the primary treatment strategy for gouty arthritis, but it owns an unfavorable prognosis. Therefore, the prevention and treatment of GA are essential. In China, traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) has been adopted for GA prevention and treatment for thousands of years. Gout patients are usually treated with TCM according to their different conditions, and long-term results can be achieved by improving their physical condition. And TCM has been proved to be an effective method to treat gout in modern China. Nevertheless, the pharmacological mechanism of TCM for gout is still unclear, which limits its spread. The theory of prevention and treatment of gout with TCM is more well acknowledged in China than in abroad. In this article, Chinese herbs and ancient formula for gout were summarized first. A total of more than 570 studies published from 2004 to June 2021 in PubMed, Medline, CNKI, VIP, Web of Science databases and Chinese Pharmacopoeia and traditional Chinese books were searched; the current status of TCM in the treatment of GA was summarized from the following aspects: articular chondrocyte apoptosis inhibition, antioxidative stress response, inflammatory cytokine levels regulation, uric acid excretion promotion, immune function regulation, uric acid reduction, and intestinal flora improvement in subjects with gout. The literature review concluded that TCM has a specific curative effect on the prevention and treatment of GA, particularly when combined with modern medical approaches. However, lacking a uniform definition of GA syndrome differentiation and the support of evidence-based medicine in clinical practice have provoked considerable concern in previous studies, which needs to be addressed in future research.

34844607|t|Herbal plants traded at the Kaili medicinal market, Guizhou, China.
34844607|a|BACKGROUND: Marketplaces reflect not only the commerce of an area, but also its culture. In Qiandongnan Miao and Dong Autonomous Prefecture with Kaili as its capital, Guizhou Province, China, traditional medicine is thriving in both rural and urban areas. The local people rely extensively on plants for traditional medicines, and these are commonly sold in local specialized markets. The Kaili medicinal market is the biggest in the prefecture. However, ethnobotanical study on herbal plants traded in the traditional market in Kaili has not been performed. The aims of this study are: (1) to document medicinal plants traded in the Kaili traditional market and the associated traditional knowledge; and (2) to analyze the level of agreement among vendors in the purported uses of medicinal plants by using informant consensus (FIC) and the fidelity level (FL). METHODS: Market surveys were conducted in 2014-2019 to collect information about medicinal plants and associated traditional knowledge. Information including vernacular names, preparation methods, and plant uses was obtained by interviewing 116 vendors of herbal plants. Specimens of fresh and dried herbs, collected as vouchers, were identified by the authors and other botanists at the Minzu University of China, and deposited in the herbarium at Minzu University of China. The level of agreement among information provided by different vendors was assessed using the FIC, and the percentage of vendors claiming the use of a certain medicinal plant for the same indication was assessed with the FL. RESULTS: The Miao people comprise 53.4% of all informants in this study of medicinal plants. In total, 237 medicinal plant species traded in the Kaili traditional market were recorded. They belong to 219 genera and 107 families. These plants have been categorized into their purported treatments for 20 medical conditions. The inflammation category showed the highest FIC value of 0.95, showing the best agreement among market vendors claiming its usefulness to treat this condition. The FL index helped to identify 15 culturally important medicinal plant species based on the reported uses by 20 or more vendors in the market. Three medicinal plant species, Eleutherococcus gracilistylus, Sargentodoxa cuneata, and Stephania cepharantha, had an FL > 90%, being used to treat sprains/traumas, rheumatism, and heat/toxins. CONCLUSIONS: The medicinal plants sold in the Kaili market are highly diverse and have unique medicinal characteristics. The Miao people often use traditional herbal plants for disease prevention and thereby prioritize the use of medicinal plants in everyday life. The future of this medicinal marketplace, however, is uncertain since few young people (< 30 years old) are vendors or customers. Therefore, it is urgent to conserve traditional ethnomedicinal culture in local communities and pass on the associated traditional knowledge to future generations in this prefecture. And the next step should include further studies on FL > 90% plants' chemistry, pharmacology, biological activity, and toxicity for potentially developing functional foods or pharmaceutical products.

34934326|t|A Comparison of the Risk of Fracture in Rheumatoid Arthritis Patients with and without Receiving Chinese Herbal Medicine.
34934326|a|OBJECTIVE: Patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) often suffer from bone complications due to persistent joint inflammation, especially incident fracture. Nowadays, Chinese herbal medicines (CHMs) have provided safe and effective therapy for treating skeletal conditions, but it is unclear whether CHMs can prevent fracture onset among RA individuals. This study aimed to determine the association between the use of CHMs and the risk of fracture among them. METHODS: This retrospective, population-based study retrieved administrative health data from the Taiwan National Health Insurance (NHI) database to identify patients with newly diagnosed RA between 2000 and 2009. Of the 6178 incident RA patients, 2495 matched pairs of CHMs users and non-CHMs users were identified by propensity score matching. Enrollees with hip fractures prior to RA onset were excluded. Included subjects were followed until the end of 2013. Incidence and adjusted hazard ratios (HR) of new-onset bone fracture in the multivariable Cox proportional hazard model were measured with 95% confidence interval (CI). RESULTS: Fracture incidence was lower in CHMs users than in the comparison cohort (26.91 vs 32.94 per 1000 person-years, respectively), with an adjusted HR of 0.82 (95% CI: 0.73-0.92). Subjects receiving CHMs for more than 2 years had a much lower risk of fracture onset by more than 50%. Some CHMs prescriptions (Yan Hu Suo, Bei Mu, Da Huang, Dang Shen, Fu-Zi, Shu-Jing-Huo-Xue-Tang, Dang-Gui-Nian-Tong-Tang, Jia-Wei-Xiao-Yao-San, Gan-Lu-Yin, and Gui-Zhi-Shao-Yao-Zhi-Mu-Tang) were associated with reduced fracture risk. CONCLUSION: Adding CHMs to routine treatment was found to be related to lower fracture risk in RA patients.

35096102|t|Evidence for the Use of Complementary and Alternative Medicine for Pelvic Inflammatory Disease: A Literature Review.
35096102|a|Pelvic inflammatory disease (PID), a common infectious disease of the female reproductive tract, is mainly characterized by abdominal/pelvic pain and tenderness of the uterus, cervix, or adnexa on physical exam. In recent years, its incidence has gradually increased yearly due to numerous factors, including sexually transmitted diseases and intrauterine operations. Based on self-report of PID in the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) 2013-2014 survey, PID impacts approximately 2.5 million women in the US during their reproductive age. Although empiric treatments such as antibiotics or surgery could alleviate the related symptoms of PID, its unsatisfactory obstetric outcome and high relapse bring heavy physical and psychological burden to women. Complementary and alternative medicine (CAM), a complementary therapy other than Western medicine with a complete theoretical and practical system, has been attached to importance in the world due to its remarkable efficacy. More people are accepting and trying to use CAM to treat gynecological diseases, including infertility, polycystic ovary syndrome, and PID, but its efficacy and mechanism are still controversial. This article reviews the previous literature systematically focusing on the effectiveness, safety, and mechanism of CAM in the treatment of PID to provide an evidence-based basis for the clinical application of CAM in patients with PID.

35250565|t|Ethnobotanical Survey on Bitter Tea in Taiwan.
35250565|a|Ethnopharmacological evidence: In Taiwan, herbal tea is considered a traditional medicine and has been consumed for hundreds of years. In contrast to regular tea, herbal teas are prepared using plants other than the regular tea plant, Camellia sinensis (L.) Kuntze. Bitter tea (ku-cha), a series of herbal teas prepared in response to common diseases in Taiwan, is often made from local Taiwanese plants. However, the raw materials and formulations have been kept secret and verbally passed down by store owners across generations without a fixed recipe, and the constituent plant materials have not been disclosed. Aim of the study: The aim was to determine the herbal composition of bitter tea sold in Taiwan, which can facilitate further studies on pharmacological applications and conserve cultural resources. Materials and methods: Interviews were conducted through a semi-structured questionnaire. The surveyed respondents were traditional sellers of traditional herbal tea. The relevant literature was collated for a systematic analysis of the composition, characteristics, and traditional and modern applications of the plant materials used in bitter tea. We also conducted an association analysis of the composition of Taiwanese bitter tea with green herb tea (qing-cao-cha tea), another commonly consumed herbal tea in Taiwan, as well as herbal teas in neighboring areas outside Taiwan. Results: After visiting a total of 59 stores, we identified 32 bitter tea formulations and 73 plant materials. Asteraceae was the most commonly used family, and most stores used whole plants. According to a network analysis of nine plant materials used in high frequency as drug pairs, Tithonia diversifolia and Ajuga nipponensis were found to be the core plant materials used in Taiwanese bitter tea. Conclusion: Plant materials used in Taiwanese bitter tea were distinct, with multiple therapeutic functions. Further research is required to clarify their efficacy and mechanisms.

35264584|t|The flavonoid corylin exhibits lifespan extension properties in mouse.
35264584|a|In the long history of traditional Chinese medicine, single herbs and complex formulas have been suggested to increase lifespan. However, the identification of single molecules responsible for lifespan extension has been challenging. Here, we collected a list of traditional Chinese medicines with potential longevity properties from pharmacopeias. By utilizing the mother enrichment program, we systematically screened these traditional Chinese medicines and identified a single herb, Psoralea corylifolia, that increases lifespan in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Next, twenty-two pure compounds were isolated from Psoralea corylifolia. One of the compounds, corylin, was found to extend the replicative lifespan in yeast by targeting the Gtr1 protein. In human umbilical vein endothelial cells, RNA sequencing data showed that corylin ameliorates cellular senescence. We also examined an in vivo mammalian model, and found that corylin extends lifespan in mice fed a high-fat diet. Taken together, these findings suggest that corylin may promote longevity.

35303920|t|Traditional knowledge of edible plants used as flavoring for fish-grilling in Southeast Guizhou, China.
35303920|a|BACKGROUND: The local Dong people in Qiandongnan Prefecture, Guizhou Province, China, with rich biocultural diversity, have developed the traditional rice-duckweed-fish-duck agroecosystem (RDFDA) to support biodiversity conservation and to meet food and cultural needs. However, there is still not much research on traditional ecological knowledge (TEK) in this area. In particular, there is a lack of traditional knowledge of edible plants used by the Dong people as flavoring to grill fish (Cyprinus carpio) collected from RDFDA, which is extremely valuable in their traditional culture. The study focused on documenting plant species used in grilling fish and analyzing the status of its TEK. METHODS: Twenty-one sampling points of three Dong minority villages in Qiandongnan were selected for the research. The local TEK associated with plant resources for fish-grilling was recorded through free listing and semi-structured interviews. Fidelity level (FL) and ethnoecological importance value (EIV) indicators were designed to determine the socioeconomic influence of TEK. The non-metric multidimensional scaling (NMDS) method was used to evaluate the differentiation of edible plant species distribution in dissimilar accessibility types. RESULTS: A total of 430 people were interviewed about grilled fish, of whom 75% were men and 85% were farmers. Thirty-four edible plants were documented for fish-grilling in three Dong villages. They belong to 16 plant families, such as Apiaceae, and Asteraceae. The life forms included herbaceous (76%), shrubs (18%) and trees (6%). Leaves are the most commonly used part of for grilling fish, followed by aerial parts, and whole plants. Among these edible plants, Allium hookeri, A. macrostemon and Houttuynia cordata with the highest fidelity level (100%) were cited as edible plants for grilling fish by all informants. The NMDS showed different accessibility types of collection sites, with different importance values. Paddy rice field edge (2.03) has the highest value, followed by forest-farming ecotone (1.74), streamsides (1.71) and woodland (0.48). CONCLUSION: The purpose of this study was to investigate the traditional knowledge of edible plant materials used by the Dong people for grilling fish. The results demonstrate the strong connection between local people, the bio-environment and agroecosystem services. The survey and comparative analysis revealed that plant species with high FL values may be potential sources of natural flavors.

35368771|t|General Use of Chinese Herbal Products among Female Patients with Mastitis in Taiwan.
35368771|a|Objectives: Little information is available regarding the use of Chinese herbal medicine to treat mastitis. This study evaluated the prescription patterns of Chinese herbal medicine products in women with mastitis in Taiwan. Design: This is a population-based cross-sectional study. Setting. 8,531 women aged 20-49 years, who received a diagnosis of mastitis between 2004 and 2013, were identified from the Longitudinal Health Insurance Database in Taiwan. We collected data on demographic characteristics, including age, monthly insurance premium, and urbanization level. The ten most Chinese herbal medicines prescribed for mastitis were assessed, including frequency, percentage, average daily dose, and average duration of prescription. Main outcome measures. We analysed the ten most single Chinese herbs and Chinese herbal formulae prescribed for mastitis. Results: Overall, 437 (5.1%) women received Chinese herbal medicine to treat mastitis. Mai Men Dong (Ophiopogon japonicus (Thunb.) Ker Gawl.; 22.3%), Pu Gong Yin (Taraxacum mongolicum Hand.-Mazz.; 7.8%), and Wang Bu Liu Xing (Vaccaria hispanica (Mill.) Rauschert; 3.5%) were three of the most commonly prescribed single Chinese herbs for mastitis. Xian-Fang-Huo-Ming-Yin (18.2%), Jia-Wei-Xiao-Yao-San (9.1%), and Chai-Hu-Shu-Gan-San (8.4%) were three of the most commonly prescribed Chinese herbal formulae. Conclusion: Xian-Fang-Huo-Ming-Yin can clear heat, detoxify body, alleviate swelling, activate blood, and relieve pain. It was the most frequently prescribed Chinese herbal formula in patients with mastitis.

35379276|t|Chinese herbal medicines in the treatment of ulcerative colitis: a review.
35379276|a|OBJECTIVE: To investigate how the ulcerative colitis (UC) be treated with Chinese herbal medicines (CHM), using Chinese medicine (CM) pattern (zheng) identification, in the current clinical practice. METHODS: A total of 7 electronic databases were systematically searched for UC clinical studies with CHM interventions (including single herbs and CHM formulas) published in English and Chinese from the date of their inception to November 25, 2020. Descriptive statistics were adopted to demonstrate the characteristics of study design, and to collate the commonly CM patterns of UC and frequently used CHM herbs and formulas. Further, IBM SPSS Modeler 18.0 and Cytoscape 3.7.1 software were used to analyze and visualize the associations between different categories of CHM and their zheng indications. RESULTS: A total of 2311 articles were included in this study, of which most (> 90%) were RCTs with CHM formulas. The most common zheng of UC was Large intestine dampness-heat, while the basic type of CM patten was Spleen deficiency. The most frequently used classical formula was Bai-Tou-Weng-Tang, followed by Shen-Ling-Bai-Zhu-San, and the commonly used proprietary CHM was Xi-Lei-San (enema). Sulfasalazine and Mesalazine are commonly used as concomitant western medicines. The most frequently used single medicinals were Huang Lian and Bai Zhu, which also identified as the core herbs for different CM patterns. CONCLUSION: This study examined the application of CHM interventions for UC and summarized their characteristics in clinical practice. These data indicated there were limited information about the safety assessment of CHM formulas and further RCTs including CM pattern(s) with strict design are necessary.

35413882|t|Operational definition of complementary, alternative, and integrative medicine derived from a systematic search.
35413882|a|BACKGROUND: Identifying what therapies constitute complementary, alternative, and/or integrative medicine (CAIM) is complex for a multitude of reasons. An operational definition is dynamic, and changes based on both historical time period and geographical location whereby many jurisdictions may integrate or consider their traditional system(s) of medicine as conventional care. To date, only one operational definition of "complementary and alternative medicine" has been proposed, by Cochrane researchers in 2011. This definition is not only over a decade old but also did not use systematic methods to compile the therapies. Furthermore, it did not capture the concept "integrative medicine", which is an increasingly popular aspect of the use of complementary therapies in practice. An updated operational definition reflective of CAIM is warranted given the rapidly increasing body of CAIM research literature published each year. METHODS: Four peer-reviewed or otherwise quality-assessed information resource types were used to inform the development of the operational definition: peer-reviewed articles resulting from searches across seven academic databases (MEDLINE, EMBASE, AMED, PsycINFO, CINAHL, Scopus and Web of Science); the "aims and scope" webpages of peer-reviewed CAIM journals; CAIM entries found in online encyclopedias, and highly-ranked websites identified through searches of CAIM-related terms on HONcode. Screening of eligible resources, and data extraction of CAIM therapies across them, were each conducted independently and in duplicate. CAIM therapies across eligible sources were deduplicated. RESULTS: A total of 101 eligible resources were identified: peer-reviewed articles (n = 19), journal "aims and scope" webpages (n = 22), encyclopedia entries (n = 11), and HONcode-searched websites (n = 49). Six hundred four unique CAIM terms were included in this operational definition. CONCLUSIONS: This updated operational definition is the first to be informed by systematic methods, and could support the harmonization of CAIM-related research through the provision of a standard of classification, as well as support improved collaboration between different research groups.




35712089|t|The PI3K/AKT Pathway-The Potential Key Mechanisms of Traditional Chinese Medicine for Stroke.
35712089|a|Stroke is associated with a high disability and fatality rate, and adversely affects the quality of life of patients and their families. Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) has been used effectively in the treatment of stroke for more than 2000 years in China and surrounding countries and regions, and over the years, this field has gleaned extensive clinical treatment experience. The Phosphatidylinositol 3 kinase (PI3K)/protein kinase B (AKT) pathway is important for regulation of cell migration, proliferation, differentiation, and apoptosis, and plays a vital role in vascularization and oxidative stress in stroke. Current Western medicine treatment protocols for stroke include mainly pharmacologic or mechanical thrombectomy to restore blood flow. This review collates recent advances in the past 5 years in the TCM treatment of stroke involving the PI3K/AKT pathway. TCM treatment significantly reduces neuronal damage, inhibits cell apoptosis, and delays progression of stroke via various PI3K/AKT-mediated downstream pathways. In the future, TCM can provide new perspectives and directions for exploring the key factors, and effective activators or inhibitors that affect occurrence and progression of stroke, thereby facilitating treatment.

35729593|t|Ethnobotany of medicinal plants used by the Yao people in Gongcheng County, Guangxi, China.
35729593|a|BACKGROUND: Gongcheng Yao Autonomous County (Gongcheng) is typical for the Yao people in northeastern Guangxi, southern China. The Yao people have a long history of using medicinal plants. In this study, we used ethnobotanical methods to collect traditional knowledge regarding herbal medicines in Gongcheng. Our study provides fundamental data for developing and applying local ethnic medicines and their protection. METHODS: Ethnobotanical data were collected from 103 villages in nine townships from 2014 to 2018 in Gongcheng. A total of 352 informants (279 male and 73 female) were interviewed through semi-structured interviews, key informant interviews, and guided field walks. All the informants were local inhabitants aged between 28 and 101 years of age, of which 40 key informants were selected based on the recommendations of knowledgeable elders and local medical institutions. The informant consensus factor (ICF) was used to evaluate the degree and importance of differences in medicinal plant species and calculated the relative frequencies of citation (RFC) for the recorded medicinal plants. RESULTS: Data from 352 local healers were collected for the study. The Guanyin and Sanjiang townships had the highest distribution of per capita healers (Pch), while the Gongcheng, Lianhua, and Ping'an townships were relatively lower. Of the 352 local healers, more than half were older than 60 years of age and therefore faced the problem of suitable successors and potential loss of traditional medicinal knowledge. There are 12 types of diseases treated by local healers in the study area, and most of the types had a high ICF value. The highest ICF (0.80) was reported for digestive system disease, followed by urinary system disease (0.78) and nervous system disease (0.77). Traumatic injury and orthopedics, digestive system, and rheumatic disease are the most common ailments. The RFC value calculated in 33 medicinal plant species (with an FC of more than 5) ranged from 0.024 to 0.056. The higher RFC values included Kadsura longipedunculata, Schefflera heptaphylla, Plantago asiatica, etc. The most commonly used medicinal method was decoction; plasters, creams, and some form of moxibustion and cupping skills were locally practiced, but only rarely. The local healers used 306 medicinal plant species (116 families and 255 genera). Herbal plants were most commonly used among these, with whole plants and roots being favored. CONCLUSION: The Yao people are highly skilled at using medicinal plants to treat various diseases in Gongcheng. Their treatment methods are varied, convenient, and efficient. Due to the impact of urbanization and economic development, knowledge of traditional medicine is under threat, with declining numbers of local healers and a lack of suitable successors. In order to protect and inherit Yao's traditional medicinal knowledge, it is necessary to educate young healers and to protect biodiversity.

35845488|t|Next-generation sequencing and targeted quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction for detection of Akebiae Caulis in the traditional Chinese medical formula Longdan Xiegan Wan.
35845488|a|Background: Akebiae Caulis (Mu Tong) is commonly misused by Aristolochiae Manshuriensis Caulis (Guan Mutong) and Clematidis Armandii Caulis (Chuan Mutong), which are nephrotoxic and carcinogenic. However, in the Pharmacopoeia of the People's Republic of China (2015 Edition), the method for determining Akebiae Caulis remains undefined. Methods: We used DNA barcode-based next-generation sequencing (NGS) combined with quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) to detect Akebiae Caulis in Longdan Xiegan Wan (LDXGW) for the first time. Compared with chromatographic studies, NGS enables better evaluation of the ingredient components of traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) preparations. The feasibility of qPCR using species-specific primers to determine the authenticity of species has been validated. In this study, the constituents of Akebiae Caulis in LDXGW from three different manufacturers were scanned by NGS. The independently developed qPCR detection primers of Akebiae Caulis, Aristolochiae Manshuriensis Caulis, and Clematidis Armandii Caulis were specifically used to analyze the LDXGW mentioned above. Results: The results showed that qPCR detected Clematidis Armandii Caulis in all commercial samples. Meanwhile, NGS detected the counterfeit species Clematis peterae (Tie-Xian Lian) in all samples. We found that qPCR shows a difference in detecting Akebiae Caulis, but it was not able to identify the unknown additives and adulterants for the primer pairs of Clematidis Armandii Caulis. Conclusions: Hence, it is sensitive and rapid, qPCR is not suitable for detection alone. The NGS approaches offer important novel insights that complement the qPCR method. The combination of NGS and qPCR will be a powerful complement to traditional identification methods of TCM substances.

35873759|t|Efficacy and Safety of Oral Chinese Herbal Medicine for Migraine: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analyses Using Robust Variance Estimation Model.
35873759|a|Background: Migraine is a prevalent headache disorder with significant impacts on patients' quality of life and economic burden. Chinese herbal medicine (CHM) is commonly prescribed for migraine in China. This review aimed to provide a rigorous evaluation of evidence on the efficacy of oral CHM for migraine and explore the correlation between its effect size and treatment duration. Methods: We searched nine digital databases (PubMed, EMBASE, CINAHL, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, AMED, BioMedical Literature, CNKI, CQVIP, and Wanfang Data) from their inceptions to May 2021, with the language being restricted to Chinese and English. Randomized, placebo-controlled trials using oral CHM to treat adult migraine were included. Data screening and extraction were conducted by two independent reviewers. The methodological quality of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) was assessed using the Cochrane Risk of Bias tool. Meta-analyses were conducted to estimate the effect size using a random effect model, and a robust variance estimation (RVE) model was constructed to explore the correlation between treatment effects and treatment duration. The certainty of the evidence was assessed with the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation. Publication bias was tested using a funnel plot and Egger's test. Results: A total of 18 RCTs involving 3,015 participants were included. Results of the meta-analyses showed that, at the end of the treatment phase, CHM was more efficacious than placebo in reducing migraine frequency, migraine days, and pain severity, and increasing response rate. Additionally, CHM showed superior effects to placebo in lowering migraine frequency and pain severity at the end of the 4-week follow-up. The RVE model suggested that the benefits of CHM for migraine frequency and pain intensity increased as treatment duration extended. The number of adverse events reported by the CHM and placebo groups was comparable. The certainty of the evidence was graded as "moderate." No publication bias was detected. Conclusion: Oral CHM appeared to be more efficacious than placebo for reducing migraine frequency and pain severity. Greater treatment effects were associated with longer treatment duration. The oral CHM was well tolerated. Systematic Review Registration: https://www.crd.york.ac.uk/prospero/#recordDetails, identifier: CRD42021270719.

36160391|t|Chinese endemic medicinal plant Bolbostemma paniculatum (Maxim.) Franquet: A comprehensive review.
36160391|a|Bolbostemma paniculatum (Maxim.) Franquet is a unique species in China with a long history of medicinal use, which has the effects of detoxifying, dissolving lumps and dispersing swellings. And it is commonly used to treat many diseases, such as carbuncle and sore, acute mastitis, mammary cancer, scrofula and subcutaneous nodule traditionally. Modern clinical studies have found that B. paniculatum and its compounds can be used for the treatment of a variety of cancers, mastitis, hyperplasia of mammary glands, chronic lymphadenitis, cervical lymph tuberculosis and surgical wart skin diseases, and the curative effect is positive. At present, a variety of Chinese patent medicines containing B. paniculatum have been exploited and marketed in China for the treatment of cancers, breast diseases and flat warts. This review article comprehensively discussed the traditional application, botany, chemical components, pharmacological activities, and quality control of B. paniculatum, put forward some noteworthy issues and suggestions in current studies, and briefly discussed the possible development potential of this plant as well as future research perspectives. 96 compounds have been isolated from B. paniculatum, including triterpenoids, sterols, alkaloids and other components, of which triterpenoid saponins are the main bioactive components. The crude extracts and monomer compounds of B. paniculatum have a wide range of pharmacological activities, such as anti-tumor, antiviral, anti-inflammatory, immunoregulatory, and so on. Moreover, its anti-tumor mechanism involves many aspects, including inhibiting cell proliferation, promoting cell apoptosis, blocking the cell cycle, interfering with cell invasion and metastasis, suppressing angiogenesis, and regulating autophagy. While there is a lack of systematic and in-depth research on its anti-tumor active components and mechanism of action at the moment; and a tight connection between the chemical composition and pharmacological activity of B. paniculatum has also not been established. Besides, a systematic quality determination standard for B. paniculatum should also be built, in order to carry out further research.

36438031|t|Chinese herbal medicine for migraine management: A hospital-based retrospective analysis of electronic medical records.
36438031|a|Background: Migraine is a chronic neurological disease causing significant socioeconomic burden and impaired quality of life. Chinese medicine is commonly used for migraine in China. Clinical trials have generated evidence of the effectiveness of Chinese medicine therapies for migraine. However, little is known about how to use these therapies to treat migraine in real-world clinical settings. Methods: In this retrospective study, we analyzed data from the electronic medical records (EMRs) of 2,023 migraine patients who attended the Guangdong Provincial Hospital of Chinese Medicine (GPHCM) between July 2018 and July 2020. Results: More than three-quarters (77.21%) of the patients were female. Most (78.20%) of the patients were aged between 18 and 50 years, 18.49% were aged above 50 years, and the remaining 3.31% were under 18 years. Sleep disorders were the most documented comorbidity occurring in 27.29% of patients, and more common in females (29.77%) than male (18.87%). Fatigue was the most frequently reported trigger of migraine attacks among all patients (9.39%), while menstruation was the most common trigger for female patients (10.24%). Less than a quarter of patients (21.01%) reported a history of taking analgesic medication for their migraine. The median treatment duration reported by the patients was 10 days. Chinese herbal medicine (CHM) was the predominant treatment for migraine at the hospital (88.48%), while pharmacotherapies were prescribed to 28.97% of the patients. CHM was prescribed more often as a sole treatment (53.58% of patients) than combined with pharmacotherapies (27.39% of patients). Among patients who reported improvements after taking CHM, the most frequently used herbs were fu ling and chuan xiong, the most frequent patented CHM product was tong tian oral solution, and the main herbal formulae were chuan xiong cha tiao san and yi qi cong ming tang. Conclusion: CHM formulae, such as chuan xiong cha tiao san and yi qi cong ming tang, patented CHM product tong tian oral solution, and some herbs are potentially effective treatments for migraine. As such, CHM can be used as an alternative to conventional pharmacotherapies for migraine and is worth further evaluation in randomized controlled trials.

36924402|t|Generic classification of Asian horned toads (Anura: Megophryidae: Megophryinae) and monograph of Chinese species.
36924402|a|The subfamily Megophryinae, as a representative batrachian group of the Oriental Realm and one of the most diverse groups of amphibians, has attracted considerable attention due to continued conjecture regarding its generic classification and failure to reach a satisfactory consensus. China boasts the richest diversity of Asian horned toads, containing some two thirds of the total species cataloged. However, most species have a complicated taxonomic history, resulting in multiple misidentifications. As such, an overall clarification of historical records and regional checklists is required. In the current investigation, we established the phylogeny of the Asian horned toads and performed detailed examinations with redefinitions of several important morphological traits. Based on the phylogenetic relationships and morphological differences, we propose a new ten-genus classification for the Asian horned toad subfamily Megophryinae: i.e., Brachytarsophrys, Atympanophrys, Grillitschia, Sarawakiphrys gen. nov., Jingophrys gen. nov., Xenophrys, Megophrys, Pelobatrachus, Ophryophryne, and Boulenophrys. Revisions on the diagnosability, distribution, and content of each genus are provided. Furthermore, we present a careful review of the taxonomic history of Asian horned toad species from China and provide a monograph of congeners, including six species of Brachytarsophrys, four species of Atympanophrys, five species of Jingophrys gen. nov., 10 species of Xenophrys, two species of Ophryophryne, and 60 species of Boulenophrys. Finally, we discuss the importance of traditional morphological traits based on multiple populations in taxonomic work as well as taxonomic inflation caused by the genetic species delimitation.

37097811|t|Engineering MMP-2 Activated Nanoparticles Carrying B7-H3 Bispecific Antibodies for Ferroptosis-Enhanced Glioblastoma Immunotherapy.
37097811|a|Administration of bispecific antibodies (biAbs) in tumor therapy is limited by their short half-life and off-target toxicity. Optimized strategies or targets are needed to overcome these barriers. B7-H3 (CD276), a member of the B7 superfamily, is associated with poor survival in glioblastoma (GBM) patients. Moreover, a dimer of EGCG (dEGCG) synthesized in this work enhanced the IFN-gamma-induced ferroptosis of tumor cells in vitro and in vivo. Herein, we prepared recombinant anti-B7-H3xCD3 biAbs and constructed MMP-2-sensitive S-biAb/dEGCG@NPs to offer a combination treatment strategy for efficient and systemic GBM elimination. Given their GBM targeted delivery and tumor microenvironment responsiveness, S-biAb/dEGCG@NPs displayed enhanced intracranial accumulation, 4.1-, 9.5-, and 12.3-fold higher than that of biAb/dEGCG@NPs, biAb/dEGCG complexes, and free biAbs, respectively. Furthermore, 50% of GBM-bearing mice in the S-biAb/dEGCG@NP group survived longer than 56 days. Overall, S-biAb/dEGCG@NPs can induce GBM elimination by boosting the ferroptosis effect and enhancing immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) immunotherapy and may be successful antibody nanocarriers for enhanced cancer therapy.

37123914|t|Isolation of oleanolic acid from Clematis armandii for differentiation it from adulterants by HPTLC/HPLC.
37123914|a|Clematis armandii has been used in many Chinese traditional patent medicines all over the world as a form of Caulis Clematidis Armandii. However, it has often been adulterated by Aristolochia manshuriensis, and Iodes vitiginea. A. manshuriensis must not be part of any herbal medicines because it contains aristolochic acid I, a nephrotoxin and potential carcinogen. The current pharmacopoeial methods have had limitation for differentiation of C. armandii from its adulterants. Thus, a specific, comprehensive, sensitive, and reproducible HPTLC/HPLC for quality control of C. armandii was proposed. Oleanolic acid from C. armandii has been isolated by vacuum liquid chromatography and column chromatography. The purified compound has been identified using Ultra Violet spectrophotometry (UV-Vis), Fourier Transform Infrared (FTIR), mass spectrometry (MS) and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy. Therefore, oleanolic acid should be detected for positive identification of Caulis Clematis Armandii. Minimum content of oleanolic acid can be evaluated by the validated HPTLC procedure proposed as well.

37153357|t|Integration of Chinese Herbal Medicine into Routine Care Was Related to Lower Risk of Chronic Kidney Disease in Patients with Rheumatoid Arthritis: A Population-Based Nested Case-Control Study in Taiwan.
37153357|a|Objective: Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are frequently used as the first-line agents for the symptomatic relief of rheumatoid arthritis (RA), but it may insidiously provoke the onset of renal diseases, especially chronic kidney disease (CKD). While Chinese herbal medicine (CHM) has become an increasingly popular adjunctive therapy among RA groups, there are currently no available data on the effect of CHM use towards risk of CKD. This study aimed to explore on a population-level whether CHM use decreases sequent CKD risk among them. Methods: In this nested case-control study retrieved from the nationwide insurance database of Taiwan from 2000 to 2012, we looked at the association between CHM use and the likelihood of developing CKD, with a focus on usage intensity. Cases with CKD claims were defined and matched to one randomly selected control case. Conditional logistic regression was then applied to estimate odds ratio (OR) of CKD from CHM treatment measured before the index date. For each OR, we calculated a 95% confidence interval for CHM use relative to the matched control. Results: This nested case-control study included 5464 patients with RA, where after matching comprised 2712 cases and 2712 controls. Among them, there were 706 and 1199 cases that ever received CHM treatment, respectively. After the adjustment, CHM use in RA individuals was related to a lower likelihood of CKD, with an adjusted OR of 0.49 (95% CI: 0.44-0.56). Additionally, a dose-dependent, reverse association was found between the cumulative duration of CHM use and risk of CKD. Conclusion: Integrating CHM into conventional therapy may reduce the likelihood of developing CKD, which could be a reference in instituting novel preventive strategies to improve treatment outcomes and reduce related fatalities for RA subjects.

37254191|t|Diversity and traditional knowledge of medicinal plants used by Shui people in Southwest China.
37254191|a|BACKGROUND: The Shui are a small Chinese sociolinguistic group living in Sandu Shui Autonomous County, south of Guizhou Province. The Shui people have accumulated and developed rich traditional medicinal knowledge, which has played a significant role in their healthcare. Traditional ethnic herbal medicines, like Shui ethnomedicine, have become an important resource of rural development in Guizhou Province. However, not much research has been conducted to document the medicinal plants traditionally used by the Shui people. This study's aims are (1) to record the current use of medicinal plants in Sandu County and associated traditional knowledge, including the medicinal plant species used and the types of diseases treated by local healers and any unique aspects of their preparations; (2) to analyze the most important medicinal plant species using relative frequency of citation (RFC); and (3) to provide useful information and data for possible future development and application of ethnomedicine and promote the conservation and preservation of Shui traditional medicinal knowledge. METHODS: Field surveys were conducted between July 2015 and August 2022 in Sandu County. A total of 15 local healers as key informants were interviewed. An additional 132 informants from villages and local markets were also interviewed through semistructured interviews and focal group discussions. Local Shui healers were followed during their collection of medicinal plants in the fields and recorded the medicinal plants' names, uses, and parts used. An ANOVA was used to evaluate the number of medicinal plants recognized by local healers across age-groups and townships, and relative frequencies of citation values were determined for the recorded medicinal plants. RESULTS: In this study, data collected from 15 Shui healers and 132 other informants were analyzed. The healers used fresh or dried parts of 505 plant species as medicine to treat a wide range of conditions and diseases. These plants belong to 405 genera from 156 families, with Fabaceae being the highest represented plant family. The Jiuqian township had the highest distribution of per capita healers (pch); only one local healer was in Zhonghe. Of the 15 local healers, only two were younger than 40 years of age. There is a major concern that traditional medicinal knowledge may be lost if there are not sufficient trainees or suitable successors. Among the common medicinal plants, most are herbaceous and the Shui typically use the whole plant in their medicines. There are 85 different recorded diseases treated by Shui medicinal plants, and among them, rheumatism and bone fractures have the largest number of species used. Three medicinal plant species, Isodon amethystoides, Asarum insigne, and Acorus tatarinowii, are the most commonly used ethnomedicines by the Shui people. CONCLUSION: This study demonstrated that Shui people have extensive knowledge of a diverse range of medicinal plants, many of which had not been systematically recorded before the current study. Further research on the chemistry, pharmacology, and toxicity of Shui medicinal plants will be useful for developing functional foods or pharmaceutical products, particularly those of Isodon amethystoides, Asarum insigne, and Acorus tatarinowii. Additionally, as a result of rapid economic growth, fewer young people in Shui communities pursue traditional medicinal studies. Only 15 traditional Shui healers remain in the county, and only two of them are below the age of 40 years. Therefore, to conserve Shui's traditional medicinal knowledge, initiatives and policies are required to regenerate, strengthen, and promote Shui medicinal knowledge.

37511964|t|A Review of the Potential Benefits of Herbal Medicines, Small Molecules of Natural Sources, and Supplements for Health Promotion in Lupus Conditions.
37511964|a|The Latin word lupus, meaning wolf, was in the medical literature prior to the 1200s to describe skin lesions that devour flesh, and the resources available to physicians to help people were limited. The present text reviews the ethnobotanical and pharmacological aspects of medicinal plants and purified molecules from natural sources with efficacy against lupus conditions. Among these molecules are artemisinin and its derivatives, antroquinonol, baicalin, curcumin, emodin, mangiferin, salvianolic acid A, triptolide, the total glycosides of paeony (TGP), and other supplements such as fatty acids and vitamins. In addition, medicinal plants, herbal remedies, mushrooms, and fungi that have been investigated for their effects on different lupus conditions through clinical trials, in vivo, in vitro, or in silico studies are reviewed. A special emphasis was placed on clinical trials, active phytochemicals, and their mechanisms of action. This review can be helpful for researchers in designing new goal-oriented studies. It can also help practitioners gain insight into recent updates on supplements that might help patients suffering from lupus conditions.

37605506|t|Lipid-Polymer Hybrid Nanoparticles with Both PD-L1 Knockdown and Mild Photothermal Effect for Tumor Photothermal Immunotherapy.
37605506|a|In developing countries, the incidence of colorectal cancer (CRC) is on the rise. The combination of programmed cell death ligand-1 (PD-L1) siRNA (siPD-L1) and mild photothermal therapy (PTT) is a promising strategy for CRC treatment. In this study, dopamine-modified polyethylenimine (PEI) was prepared to fabricate an IR780 and siPD-L1 codelivery lipid-polymer hybrid nanoparticle (lip@PSD-siP) for the photothermal immunotherapy of CRC. The modification of dopamine can significantly reduce the cytotoxicity of PEI. lip@PSD-siP can be effectively taken up by CT26 cells and successfully escaped from lysosomes after entering the cells for 4 h. After CT26 cells were transfected with lip@PSD-siP, the PD-L1 positive cell rate decreased by 82.4%, and its PD-L1 knockdown effect was significantly stronger than the positive control Lipo3000-siP. In vivo studies showed that lip@PSD-siP-mediated mild PTT and efficient PD-L1 knockdown exhibited primary and distal tumor inhibition, metastasis delay, and rechallenged tumor inhibition. The treatment with lip@PSD-siP significantly promoted the maturation of dendritic cells in lymph nodes. The amount of T cell infiltration in the tumor tissues increased significantly, and the frequency of CD8+ T cells and CD4+ T cells was significantly higher than that of other groups. The percentage of immunosuppressive regulatory cells (Tregs) in the tumor tissue on the treatment side decreased by 88% compared to the PBS group, and the proportion of CD8+CD69+ T cells in the distal tumor tissue was 2.8 times that of the PBS group. The memory T cells of mice in the long-term antitumor model were analyzed. The results showed that after treatment with lip@PSD-siP, the frequency of effector memory T cells (Tem cells) significantly increased, suggesting the formation of immune memory.

37641665|t|Acquisition and Dissemination of Anti-Epidemic Medical Prescriptions During the Outbreaks in the Qing Dynasty of China.
37641665|a|During the epidemics in the Qing dynasty, many medical professionals, nonprofessionals, and social organizations collected and sorted medical prescriptions related to infectious diseases. These people also compiled, published, disseminated, and consulted related medical formularies. The above historical event can be viewed as the construction and dissemination of medical knowledge. They edited and published medical formularies on infectious diseases with lower cost and in flexible ways by taking the initiative and giving full scope to creativity. Diverse anti-epidemic medical prescriptions from these medical formularies can be used for infectious diseases in the event of the outbreaks. However, the therapeutic effects of classical prescriptions and folk recipes cannot be regarded as the same. The wide circulation of anti-epidemic medical prescriptions and medical formularies was essentially a process of epidemic prevention resource allocation. Not only did it enable many nonprofessionals to participate in epidemic prevention and control, but it also enhanced awareness, knowledge, and capacity for epidemic prevention at the individual level. At the same time, due to the uneven quality and individual differences in the physical fitness and condition of the prescriptions and formularies, they had the capacity of causing inconveniences to the readers or patients.

37641679|t|Key to Treating COVID-19: Removing Phlegm from Small Airways.
37641679|a|According to autopsy reports, patients who died from COVID-19 had a lot of mucus in the lung that obstructed the airways, reduced the effect of mechanical ventilation, and even led to pulmonary failure. Traditional Chinese medicine literature mentions that "Inability to remove phlegm impairs the lung, which leads to death." Hence one of the most urgent problems to be solved is to remove phlegm from the small airways. This article elaborates ten methods to remove phlegm for clinical reference.

37641680|t|Thoughts on Coronavirus Disease 2019 Based on JingFang Medicine (Classical Chinese Formula) Solutions for COVID-19.
37641680|a|This article aims to provide some thoughts on the prevention and treatment of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) from the perspective of JingFang Medicine (Classical Chinese Formula). It is believed that the vague theoretical understanding of COVID-19 in Traditional Chinese Medicine does not hinder the precise treatment of the disease by following the rule of "With this Zheng, prescribe this Fang." According to the principle of "Fang-Zheng Correlation" and the knowledge gained from the thousands of years of experience in treating febrile diseases, Xiao Chai Hu Decoction () and its modifications are recommended with the emphasis on individualized treatment. As another form of practicing "Fang-Zheng Correlation," generalized group treatment should also be paid attention to. Giving considerations to the historical medical data, Jing Fang Bai Du Powder () and Shi Shen Decoction () are recommended for group prevention treatment. Assisting the Zheng (Upright) Qi and using tonic formulas are two entirely different concepts. According to the principle of "Fang-Zheng Correlation," tonics abuse should be avoided in the prevention of COVID-19, and the using of Huang Qi ( Radix Astragali seu Hedysari) should also be very carefully done.

37687308|t|Companion Plants of Tea: From Ancient to Terrace to Forest.
37687308|a|China is one of the origins of ancient tea gardens, with a long history of tea culture and tea cultivation. Guizhou Province is an important tea production place in southwest China with rich forest tea resources. The purpose of this study is to obtain historical information on companion plants in historical tea gardens and provide a theoretical basis for the sustainable development of forest tea gardens in Guizhou Province. We conducted a statistical analysis and comparison of plant species among ancient tea gardens, terrace tea gardens, and forest tea gardens from a diachronic perspective, based on 21 ancient tea literature studies, 116 terrace tea garden documents, and 18 sampled plots of forest tea gardens in Guizhou. A total of 24 companion plants species belonging to 16 families and 22 genera were found in ancient tea gardens, 81 species were found in terrace tea gardens belonging to 37 families and 74 genera, and 232 species were found in sample plots of forest tea gardens belonging to 90 families and 178 genera. Companion plants can be divided into three categories. Most of the plant families recorded in the literature also appeared in the forest tea garden we surveyed. In ancient tea gardens, terrace tea gardens, and forest tea gardens, Poaceae, Fabaceae, and Rosaceae were the most dominant families, respectively. The intercropping of tea gardens has been practiced since ancient times. Companion plants in natural forest tea gardens not only provide important insights into intercropping of terrace gardens but also hold significant implications for the conservation of existing forest tea gardens and the sustainable development of tea gardens.




37710305|t|Feed plants, ethnoveterinary medicine, and biocultural values: insights on the Luchuan pig from Hakka communities in China.
37710305|a|BACKGROUND: The Luchuan pig is an indigenous breed from Luchuan County, China, with cultural and genetic significance. However, traditional knowledge and conservation status have not been systematically documented. METHODS: Using ethnobiological methods, we surveyed 72 Luchuan pig farmers in 7 townships during 2021-2023. Semi-structured interviews and participant observation were conducted to document traditional knowledge and management practices. RESULTS: The locals reported 51 plant species used as pig feed, with 30 wild species. Growth-stage-specific feeding and seasonal adjustment practices were documented. We recorded 62 ethnoveterinary plant uses, mainly for treating pigs' heat stress and skin conditions. Luchuan pigs play central roles in local Hakka customs, rituals, and cuisine. Additonally, the new ecological farming models minimize the environmental impacts to the local community. However, there are still some challenges remained for conserving and promoting Luchuan pigs. CONCLUSIONS: The Luchuan Hakka people possess rich traditional knowledge and management experience in raising Luchuan pigs. Our study provides extensive documentation of traditional knowledge and recommends integrating cultural and genetic aspects for sustaining this biocultural heritage. Findings can inform initiatives supporting local breed conservation globally.

37777741|t|Ethnobotanical study on edible flowers in Xishuangbanna, China.
37777741|a|BACKGROUND: Edible flowers (EFs) represent valuable sources of both food and medicinal resources, holding the promise to enhance human well-being. Unfortunately, their significance is often overlooked. Ethnobotanical studies on the EFs are lacking in comparison with their botanical and phytochemical research. The practice of consuming flowers as food has a rich culture and long history in China, especially among different linguistic groups in Xishuangbanna, Yunnan. However, economic activities have led to a decline of this tradition. Consequently, preserving the traditional knowledge and culture tied to the EFs in Xishuangbanna becomes both essential and pressing. METHODS: The field ethnobotanical survey was conducted in Xishuangbanna during five visits in April 2021 and May 2023, covering 48 villages and 19 local markets of all three county-level areas and 9 different linguistic groups. By conducting a comprehensive literature review and on-site field surveys, relevant information regarding the EFs of Xishuangbanna was systematically collected and documented. Additionally, the relative frequency of citation (RFC) values were calculated from the survey data. RESULTS: A total of 212 taxa (including species and varieties) of EFs from 58 families and 141 genera were documented in the study area. The edible parts of flowers were classified into 13 categories including peduncle, petal, flower buds, inflorescence as a whole, and etc. They were consumed in 21 ways and as 8 types of food. The inflorescence was the most commonly consumed category, accounting for 85 species (40.1%) of the total categories. They always eat flowers as vegetables (184 species, 86.8%). The preparing form of stir-frying was the preferred food preparation method (138, 65.1%). The Xishuangbanna locals had profound knowledge of which EFs required specific processing to remove their toxicity or bitterness. The dishes can be made from either exclusively from the flowers themselves or by incorporating them alongside other plant parts like stems and leaves. Some EFs with high RFC value, such as Musa acuminata and Bauhinia variegata var. candida, showed significant cultural meanings. These edible flowers occupy specific positions in local traditional culture. CONCLUSION: Traditional knowledge regarding edible flowers holds substantial significance and serves as a representative element of the flower-eating culture in Xishuangbanna. Nevertheless, this knowledge and cultural practice are currently decreasing. Serving as a bridge between tradition and modernity, the flower-eating culture, which derives from local people's practical experience, shows the potential of EFs and can be applied to the conservation of biocultural diversity, healthy food systems, and sustainable development.

Accumulating evidence has indicated that Chinese herbal medicine (CHM) safely suppresses proinflammatory pathways and controls inflammation-associated disease, but its effect in reducing the risk of developing sarcopenia among RA subjects has not been established. We conducted a population-level cohort study to compare the sarcopenia risk in patients with RA who use or do not use CHM. Methods: Using claims from a nationwide insurance database, we recruited patients with newly diagnosed RA and without sarcopenia between 2002 and 2010. Propensity score matching was applied to randomly select sets of CHM users and non-CHM users to compare the sarcopenia risk until the end of 2013. The risk of new-onset sarcopenia was assessed using the Cox proportional hazards model. Results: As compared to non-CHM users, those receiving CHM treatment had a lower incidence of sarcopenia (7.69 vs 9.83 per 1000 person-years). CHM was correlated with a decreased chance of sarcopenia after controlling for potential covariates. Notably, use of CHM for more than two years may diminish the risk of getting sarcopenia by about 47% when taken as prescribed. Prescriptions of several herbal formulae may benefit the reduction of sarcopenia risk, such as Yan-Hu-Suo, Bei-Mu, Da-Huang, Huang Qin, Ping-Wei-San (PWS), Shu-Jing-Huo-Xue-Tang (SJHXT) and Chuan-Xiong-Cha-Tiao-San (CXCTS). Conclusion: This study produced new evidence as it is the first to show that the longer duration of CHM use was correlated to reduced risk of sarcopenia in a dose-dependent manner, implying that CHM treatment could be embraced as a routine care strategy for preventing sarcopenia.

38371501|t|Advancing breastfeeding promotion: leveraging integrative natural galactagogues and unveiling their potential roles-Insights from a 19-year Taiwan nationwide registry to address lactation insufficiency in postpartum women.
38371501|a|Background: Lactation insufficiency is a prevalent challenge for nursing mothers globally. There is a growing interest in the use of herbal galactagogues for enhancing lactation, but their therapeutic efficacy and underlying mechanisms need thorough investigation. This study aims to investigate the efficacy and mechanisms of action of herbal galactagogues in addressing lactation insufficiency by utilizing real-world data and employing a network analysis approach. Methods: Our retrospective study used Taiwan's Longitudinal Health Insurance Database 2000 (LHID2000) to identify 490 patients diagnosed with lactation insufficiency from 2000 to 2018. We analyzed demographic characteristics, co-existing diseases, and prescription patterns for both users and non-users of Chinese herbal products (CHP). Additionally, we utilized a network analysis approach to explore potential compounds and targets in the most frequently used CHP, the Wang Bu Liu Xing and Lu Lu Tong herb pair (WLHP) combination. Results: Out of 490 patients, 81% were CHP users. There were no significant differences in demographic characteristics between CHP users and non-users, but we observed a notable divergence in the prevalence of co-existing diseases. A detailed examination of CHP prescriptions revealed the predominance of WLHP, prompting further investigation. Comprehensive analysis identified 29 major compounds in WLHP, which were associated with 215 unique targets. Intersection analysis revealed 101 overlapping targets between WLHP and lactation, suggesting their potential as therapeutic targets for lactation insufficiency treatment. Topological analysis of the protein-protein interaction (PPI) network identified 13 hub genes potentially crucial for the therapeutic effect of WLHP. Functional enrichment analysis showed that these targets were involved in critical lactation regulation pathways, including the PI3K-Akt signaling pathway, prolactin signaling pathway, estrogen signaling pathway, and AMPK signaling pathway. Discussion: This study emphasizes the potential of CHP, specifically the WLHP combination, in managing lactation insufficiency. The multi-compound, multi-target approach of WLHP and its interaction with key biological processes and signaling pathways offer valuable insights into the underlying mechanisms of its therapeutic effects. These findings warrant further experimental validation and can guide future research and clinical applications of CHP in lactation insufficiency treatment.

38454483|t|A multi-center cross-sectional study of Chinese Herbal Medicine-Drug adverse reactions using active surveillance in Singapore's Traditional Chinese Medicine clinics.
38454483|a|BACKGROUND: This study aimed to investigate the rates and causality of patient-reported adverse events (AEs) associated with concomitant Chinese Herbal Medicine (CHM) and Western Medicine prescription drug (WMPD) consumption through active surveillance in Singapore's Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) clinics. METHODS: A cross-sectional study was conducted at five TCM clinics across Singapore from 8th May till 8th July 2023. Patients were screened to determine rates of CHM and WMPD consumption, and then interviewed if an AE was reported. An expert committee assessed the AE reports to determine causality. Along with descriptive statistics, odds ratios were calculated to determine AE occurrence likelihoods for patients who consumed both CHM and WMPD compared to CHM consumption alone. RESULTS: 1028 patients were screened and 62.65% of them reported concurrent CHM-WMPD consumption. Patients who consumed CHM and WMPD were 3.65 times more likely to experience an AE as compared to CHM consumption alone. 18 AE reports were adjudicated, with most AEs deemed unlikely due to CHM consumption. CONCLUSIONS: A large proportion of patients consumed CHM and WMPD concurrently, thus increasing their risk of experiencing AEs compared to those consuming CHM only. Active surveillance is applicable for detecting AEs, collecting data for causality assessment, and analysis.

38532487|t|Medicinal plants and natural products for treating overactive bladder.
38532487|a|BACKGROUND: Overactive bladder (OAB) presents a high prevalence of 16-18% worldwide. The pathophysiology of OAB is still poorly understood while effective therapy or countermeasure are very limited. On the other hand, medicinal plants and herbal remedies have been utilized for treating lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS) in both Eastern and Western cultures since ancient times. In recent years, accumulating progress has also been made in OAB treatment research by using medicinal plants. METHODS: Relevant literature on the studies of medicinal plants and herbs used to treat OAB was reviewed. The medicinal plants were summarized and categorized into two groups, single-herb medications and herbal formulations. RESULTS: The present review has summarized current understanding of OAB's pathophysiology, its available treatments and new drug targets. Medicinal plants and natural products which have been used or have shown potential for OAB treatment were updated and comprehensively categorized. Studies on a wide variety of medicinal plants showed promising results, although only a few phytochemicals have been isolated and identified. Until now, none of these herbal compounds have been further developed into clinical therapeutics for OAB. CONCLUSIONS: This review provides the basis for discovering and designing new phytopharmaceutical candidates with effective and well-tolerated properties to treat OAB. Increasing evidences indicate new strategies with alternative herbal treatment for OAB have high efficacy and safety, showing great promise for their clinical use. Future studies in a rigorously designed controlled manner will be beneficial to further support the eligibility of herbal treatment as OAB therapeutics.

38571669|t|Guideline for the Management of Diabetes Mellitus in the Elderly in China (2024 Edition).
38571669|a|With the deepening of aging in China, the prevalence of diabetes in older people has increased noticeably, and standardized diabetes management is critical for improving clinical outcomes of diabetes in older people. In 2021, the National Center of Gerontology, Chinese Society of Geriatrics, and Diabetes Professional Committee of Chinese Aging Well Association organized experts to write the first guideline for diabetes diagnosis and treatment in older people in China, the Guideline for the Management of Diabetes Mellitus in the Elderly in China (2021 Edition). The guideline emphasizes that older patients with diabetes are a highly heterogeneous group requiring comprehensive assessment and stratified and individualized management strategies. The guideline proposes simple treatments and de-intensified treatment strategies for older patients with diabetes. This edition of the guideline provides clinicians with practical and operable clinical guidance, thus greatly contributing to the comprehensive and full-cycle standardized management of older patients with diabetes in China and promoting the extensive development of clinical and basic research on diabetes in older people and related fields. In the past 3 years, evidence-based medicine for older patients with diabetes and related fields has further advanced, and new treatment concepts, drugs, and technologies have been developed. The guideline editorial committee promptly updated the first edition of the guideline and compiled the Guideline for the Management of Diabetes Mellitus in the Elderly in China (2024 Edition). More precise management paths for older patients with diabetes are proposed, for achieving continued standardization of the management of older Chinese patients with diabetes and improving their clinical outcomes.

38584597|t|Alpha 2-adrenoceptor participates in anti-hyperalgesia by regulating metabolic demand.
38584597|a|The alpha2-adrenoceptor agonist dexmedetomidine is a commonly used drug for sedatives in clinics and has analgesic effects; however, its mechanism of analgesia in the spine remains unclear. In this study, we systematically used behavioural and transcriptomic sequencing, pharmacological intervention, electrophysiological recording and ultrasound imaging to explore the analgesic effects of the alpha2-adrenoceptor and its molecular mechanism. Firstly, we found that spinal nerve injury changed the spinal transcriptome expression, and the differential genes were mainly related to calcium signalling and tissue metabolic pathways. In addition, alpha2-adrenoceptor mRNA expression was significantly upregulated, and alpha2-adrenoceptor was significantly colocalised with markers, particularly neuronal markers. Intrathecal dexmedetomidine suppressed neuropathic pain and acute inflammatory pain in a dose-dependent manner. The transcriptome results demonstrated that the analgesic effect of dexmedetomidine may be related to the modulation of neuronal metabolism. Weighted gene correlation network analysis indicated that turquoise, brown, yellow and grey modules were the most correlated with dexmedetomidine-induced analgesic effects. Bioinformatics also annotated the involvement of metabolic processes and neural plasticity. A cardiovascular-mitochondrial interaction was found, and ultrasound imaging revealed that injection of dexmedetomidine significantly enhanced spinal cord perfusion in rats with neuropathic pain, which might be regulated by pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase 4 (pdk4), cholesterol 25-hydroxylase (ch25 h) and GTP cyclohydrolase 1 (gch1). Increasing the perfusion doses of dexmedetomidine significantly suppressed the frequency and amplitude of spinal nerve ligation-induced miniature excitatory postsynaptic currents. Overall, dexmedetomidine exerts analgesic effects by restoring neuronal metabolic processes through agonism of the alpha2-adrenoceptor and subsequently inhibiting changes in synaptic plasticity.

39057237|t|The Distribution and Host-Association of the Vector Chigger Species Leptotrombidium imphalum in Southwest China.
39057237|a|Leptotrombidium imphalum is a species of chigger mites, and it can serve as a transmitting vector of scrub typhus. Southwest China is an important focus of scrub typhus. Based on the field investigation in southwest China from 2001 to 2022, this article presents the first report on the distribution and infestation of L. imphalum on rodents and other sympatric small mammals in the region. A total of 2161 L. imphalum were identified from 218 small mammal hosts in 21 of 114 survey sites. The 17 host species of L. imphalum crossed 13 genera and 5 families in 3 orders (Rodentia, Eulipotyphla, and Scandentia), indicating the low host specificity of the mite. The Asian house rat (Rattus tanezumi) was the dominant host species in the 21 sites where L. imphalum were collected, and 49.38% of mites were found on R. tanezumi. Different small mammals had different susceptibility to the infestation of L. imphalum. The prevalence (PM = 27.66%), infestation mean abundance (MA = 6 mites/per examined host), and mean intensity (MI = 21.69 mites/per infested host) for L. imphalum on the shrew gymnure (Neotetracus sinensis) were much higher than those on other host species (p < 0.05), indicating N. sinensis had a high susceptibility to the infestation of L. imphalum. The infestation indices for L. imphalum on small mammal hosts varied along different altitude and latitude gradients (p < 0.05), indicating the environmental heterogeneity of the mite infestation. Leptotrombidium imphalum exhibited an aggregated distribution among different individuals of its hosts. Besides the low host specificity of L. imphalum, the prevalence of the mite was positively correlated with the occurrence of scrub typhus, indicating the potential risk of the mite.

39578555|t|The role of PM2.5 exposure in lung cancer: mechanisms, genetic factors, and clinical implications.
39578555|a|Lung cancer is one of the most critical global health threats, as the second most common cancer and leading cause of cancer deaths globally. While smoking is the primary risk factor, an increasing number of cases occur in nonsmokers, with lung cancer in nonsmokers (LCNS) now recognized as the fifth leading cause of cancer mortality worldwide. Recent evidence identifies air pollution, particularly fine particulate matter (PM2.5), as a significant risk factor in LCNS. PM2.5 can increase oxidative stress and inflammation, induce genetic alterations and activation of oncogenes (including the epidermal growth factor receptor, EGFR), and contribute to lung cancer progression. This review summarizes the current understanding of how exposure to PM2.5 induces lung carcinogenesis and accelerates lung cancer development. It underscores the importance of prevention and early detection while calling for targeted therapies to combat the detrimental effects of air pollution. An integrated approach that combines research, public health policy, and clinical practice is essential to reduce the lung cancer burden and improve outcomes for those affected by PM2.5 exposurrre.

39723118|t|Alternative Therapies for Non-Motor Symptoms in Parkinson's Disease: A Mini Review.
39723118|a|Parkinson's disease (PD) is primarily recognized for its motor symptoms, yet non-motor symptoms (NMS) such as neuropsychiatric disturbances, sleep disorders, autonomic dysfunction, and sensory abnormalities significantly contribute to the disease's overall burden. While traditional pharmacological and surgical treatments have primarily targeted motor symptoms, alternative therapies such as acupuncture, cognitive therapy, and Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) are gaining attention for managing NMS. This review provides a comprehensive analysis of alternative therapies for NMS in PD, drawing on evidence from international guidelines and TCM. The review highlights the current gaps in research, emphasizing the need for high-quality randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and standardized protocols, particularly in the evaluation of TCM therapies. Additionally, it underscores the potential of integrated treatment approaches that combine traditional and modern medicine, offering a personalized strategy for managing NMS in PD. By addressing these challenges, this review aims to enhance the understanding and application of alternative therapies, ultimately improving the quality of life for PD patients. These therapies, particularly those emphasizing holistic and individualized approaches, such as cognitive therapy and TCM, offer potential solutions to the unmet needs in PD management without causing side effects associated with medications or fluctuations in drug plasma levels.

39839895|t|Traditional Chinese medicine in the treatment of Helicobacter pylori-related gastritis: The mechanisms of signalling pathway regulations.
39839895|a|Helicobacter pylori-associated gastritis (HPAG) is a common condition of the gastrointestinal tract. However, extensive and long-term antibiotic use has resulted in numerous adverse effects, including increased resistance, gastrointestinal dysfunction, and increased recurrence rates. When these concerns develop, traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) may have advantages. TCM is based on the concept of completeness and aims to eliminate pathogens and strengthen the body. It has the potential to prevent this condition while also boosting the rate of Helicobacter pylori eradication. This review elaborates on the mechanism of TCM treatment for HPAG based on cellular signalling pathways, which reflects the flexibility of TCM in treating diseases and the advantages of multi-level, multi-pathway, and multi-target treatments for HPAG.

40329241|t|Chinese herbal medicines for rhinosinusitis: a text-mining study with comparisons to contemporary research and clinical guidance.
40329241|a|BACKGROUND: Rhinosinusitis is an inflammation of the paranasal sinuses and nasal cavity. It is managed with intra-nasal steroids, nasal saline irrigation, oral antibiotics and/or biologics. Chinese herbal medicines (CHMs) have long been used for nasal disorders, including rhinosinusitis, and feature in Chinese clinical guidelines for rhinosinusitis. Systematic reviews suggest some CHM formulations may be beneficial for the management of this condition. METHODS: This text mining study used an established methodology to search a database containing the full texts of more than 1,150 classical and pre-modern Chinese medicine books to identify references to disorders similar to rhinosinusitis, and the CHMs used as interventions. Ten search terms relevant to names of disorders in classical books and the major symptoms of rhinosinusitis were identified. Search results were downloaded, categorised, and analysed descriptively in SPSS . Qualitative comparisons were made with the modern clinical Chinese medicine literature. RESULTS: Searches found 436 oral CHM formulae with 3,059 ingredients, 81 nasal or other topical CHMs with 142 ingredients, and 112 single natural products from classical pharmacopoeia used orally and/or topically. The earliest reference to a disorder similar to rhinosinusitis was in a Chinese medical book written approximately 2,000 years ago. Three oral CHM formulae from the search have been tested in randomised controlled trials and one is included in a clinical guideline. A sample of 13 modern specialist textbooks on Chinese otorhinolaryngology still recommended nine of the oral classical formulae. Three of the seven herbs frequently included in the classical pharmacopoeia are still listed in the official Chinese pharmacopoeia for rhinosinusitis. Nasal formulae found in classical searches differed to those tested in randomised controlled trials, although the most frequent ingredient in the classical formulae was also frequent in modern formulae. The pharmacological actions of the seven most frequently used herbs included anti-inflammatory, anti-allergic, antioxidant and/or anti-bacterial effects that may have contributed to their observed effects. CONCLUSIONS: Results for classical interventions and the modern clinical literature overlapped for the higher frequency oral formulae and their ingredients, showing evidence of temporal continuity in their use for rhinosinusitis management. Gaps in the clinical and experimental evidence were identified, so there remains scope for further research into these CHMs to develop new interventions for rhinosinusitis.
